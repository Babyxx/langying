Guan YueAbstractBased on a large number of qualitative analysis and statistical analysis towards corpus, this paper explores the features, the meaning and the syntactic function of the construction “X zhong de X”, as well as the part of speech represented by X and its features. Moreover, it compares this construction with three related constructions, namely “hen X”, “bi X hai (yao) X” and “X jiu shi X”. This construction highlights a member because it has a very typicalSong ZuoyanSchool of Chinese Language and Literature Beijing Normal UniversityBeijing 100875 meszy@163.comfeature of the category X. Compared with the related constructions, “X zhong de X” is a typical one, both 2 Xs are referential and the descriptive feature is given by the construction meaning.1 PrefaceConstruction Grammar was originally raised for explaining some phrases, especially idioms, whose structure was hard to analyze. Its methods showed great advantages.On “X zhong de X” Construction     Time away construction      Twistin the night away    What’s X doing Y ? What’s that fly doing in my soap ?     Nominal Extraposition construction      It’s amazing the difference !    Mad Magazine Him, a doctor ?!     N P N construction   House by house ; day after day     Stranded preposition construction      Who did he give that to ?  Table 1 Productive or semi-productive constructions that are unusual cross-linguistically and must be learned on the basis of the input(Goldberg:1995)The most influential definition given by Goldberg (1995:4) is: C is a CONSTRUCTION iff C is a form-meaningpair<Fi, Si> such that some aspects of F or some aspects of S are not strictly predictable from C’s component parts of from other
previously established constructions. This definition indicates that there is a form-function pairing relationship with a construction, the whole meaning of the construction is much more than the simple combination of the meaning of its components. A revise was made by Goldberg in 2006 in which the general nature of language was added, and a broader concept was established. In this sense, a construction is a continuum from the most specific one to the most abstract one. Morpheme, words, compound words and certain phrase or sentences belong to the former, and semifixed phrases and greater units belong to the latter (Goldberg, 2006;Croft, 2001; Michaelis, 2004).The development of the theory of construction is employed in the analysis of a large number of cases. In recent years, there are many Chinese researches (Zhang Juan, 2013) who paid more attention on the independent meaning of the construction itself, while the phrase structure grammar and argument role theory were hard to explain. Moreover, a construction shows the characteristics of each language, compared with the phrase structure grammar which treats all these languages generally as a whole in cross-linguistics research.In this paper, the construction “X zhong de X”, which includes a localizer, expresses more than location through experiencing a cognitive psychological metaphor. According to Deng Bin (2008) et al., noun of locality is explicit, with the mechanism of metaphor in which human’s awareness and reasoning can be mapped on one abstract field systematically and correspondingly, the abstraction meaning based semantically on space by metaphor. As an echo structure in co-occurrence with localizer, “X zhong de X” is embodied in cognitive andpragmatics mechanisms. This structure has been studied by Wang Jie (2007), Zhu Jun (2013) and Fan Zhongyuan (2015). Wang (2007) focuses on the pragmatics of the structure and structural properties of two-way recursion mechanism; Zhu (2013) proposed that “X zhong de X” is a construction and observed its different use and the degree of constructionalization from the view of interior; Fan (2015) continued this study and divided the differences of the two “X”s into two-layer and multilayer. As these old studies had not sufficient language corpus and data statistics, this paper,based on data,discuss how “X zhong de X” can be regarded as a construction and make extensive comparisons among relative structures.2 The feature of “X zhong de X”_and its grammatical function2.1 The feature of “X zhong de X”_Xu Zhimo has a sentence:(1)幻象消灭是人生里命定的悲剧;青 年的幻灭,更是悲剧中的悲剧,夜一般的 沉黑,死一般的凶恶。1It is a predeterminate tragedy that illusion disappeared; what is the tragedy of tragedy is that the youth’s vanish seems like dark nights, and cruel death.It is a predeterminate tragedy that illusion disappeared; what’s worse, the youth’s vanish seems like dark nights, and cruel death.This sentence emphases on how tragic the disillusion of youth is, among which “悲剧 中的悲剧” can be the abstraction as “X zhong de X”. It conveys semantically the meaning of “a greater degree”, which , rather than the lexicon itself, comes from the construction. It is obvious that the  1From Center for Chinese Linguistics PKU (CCL).
overall meaning is not simply the adduction of its components, thus we call “X zhong de X” a construction.As for the feature of the construction, formally the first “X” and the localizer limit the range of the second one as an attribute; in one case the two nouns are different, “X1zhong de X2” often shows an abstract space:(2)......她到了 18 岁成人的年龄,并开 始拥有她继承的船王的全部遗产。她成为 世界上最富有的女孩。人称这又是一个 “希腊悲剧中的仙女故事”。When she was 18, she began to possess the inheritance got from the Ship King. She became one of the most richest girls in the world. It is said to be a fairy maiden story of Greek tragedy.If X2 is part of X1 , X1 has more morphemes to be modified, it is a partly co-occurrence: (3)乌龙,一种黑颜色的龙,“乌龙山” “乌龙潭”“乌龙岭”中的“乌龙”即为 此义。Wu Long is a kind of black dragon. The word “WU Long” in “Wu Long mountain”, “Wu Long pool” and “Wu Long hills” are both of the same meaning.In the two cases above, both X1 limit X2 in space category. When they are completely overlapped, it is an echo “X”, like (4) and (1).(4)由于他一贯的稳健经营作风,使其 成为金融危机中唯一未受影响的亚洲巨 富,被称为“富翁中的富翁,领袖中的领 袖”。Because he is always prudent and careful in business, he is the only millionaire of Asia who safely passed through the financial crisis and went by the name of “the rich person in the rich”, “the leader of the leaders”.Because he is always prudent and careful in business, he is the only millionaire of Asia whosafely passed through the financial crisis and famous of rich and charisma.In fact, despite “X” can be presented as formally the same, it is incorrect to semantically treat them as equal. They have a different status: the first “X” appoints to the assemblage, which underlies the category; the second “X” is one typical member of the assemblage, which is actually used to highlight the descriptive semantic meaning of the categorical feature of one certain member in it by comparison. This meaning is brought by the construction, thus “富翁中的富翁” means richer than a normal man of wealth.2.2 The grammar function of “X zhong de X”“X zhongde X” often serve as object, subject and attribute, but is especially employed as object. According to the data we found in CCL, there are 310 items of “X zhong de X” construction, among which 87.68% serve as object. The predicate element contained “Yes” words, including “是”,“为”,“称为”,“成了”and so on. The main reason is that “X zhong de X” construction implies a notable descriptive feature, which has the same function of analyzing the description meaning of nominal constituents as the assertion “Yes + noun” structure (Shi Chunhong 2002): (5)如今的叟候,几乎像北京前门一带, 是伦敦闹市中的闹市。Like Qianmen in Beijing, today’s Soho in London, is a downtown of downtowns.Like Qianmen in Beijing, today’s Soho in London, is a very busy downtown.(6)仅凭这一点,王石便可说是男人中 的男人。Just because this reason, Wang Shi is said to be the man of men.Just because this reason, Wang Shi is said to be

Subject: (9)所以,解决问题的根本中的根本就 是,严禁公务员在一张桌子上吃饭。 Thus the base of base to solve this problem is to strictly forbid public servant in one table.Thus the most fundamental thing to solve this problem is to strictly forbid public servant in one table.Attribute is used to exert both limit function and descriptive function, and is often an appositive: (10)让我们来看一下大师中的大师、细 密画的创始人的一幅画。Let’s enjoy the painting of the master of masters, the originator of miniature.Let’s enjoy the painting of the big master, the originator of miniature.(11)“战士中的战士”之威名,他们早 已目睹耳闻。They have already known his name of the fighterof fighters.They have already known he is brave.3 The word class of “X” and its feature3.1 overviewAccording to statistics, 274 among 310 are nominal, with the proportion of 88.39% (Table 2 ) :Table 2 The word class of “X” (token)The number 310 is token, if we consider repetition, while the number of type is 206 (Table 3) :Table 3 The word class of “X” (type)In the table, we can see that the word class of adjective and verb score very low, with a relevant use of “X” in nouns. High frequency of possible “X” emerges as follows:           noun   Adjective    verb   Amount   274  33   3   Percent 88.39% 10.65%  0.97%         noun   adjective     verb    amount 2004  2    percent     97.08%   1.94%     0.97%      X     frq   X     frq   精品  8名将  2  男人    8 魔术师    2  女人     7   内战     2   核心  6偶然  2  焦点    6 亲信    2  奇迹     6   少数民族     2   悲剧  5少数  2  大师    5 生命    2  战士     5   世界     2   关键  4文化   2

Firstly, “X” is typically disyllabic. It is not common to find “X” as multisyllable or monosyllable, but we still found some: (12)物理学也被认为是基础科学中的基 础科学。Physics is regarded as the basic subject of basic subjects.Physics is regarded as a very fundamental subject.(13)说贾珍是《红楼梦》里坏男人中的 坏男人,一点不为过。Jia Zhen is a bad guy of bad guys.(14)它简直是从天而降,像梦中的梦, 令人模糊不清,难以置信。It just came down from heaven, like the dream in dream.The following table shows the frequency of different length of syllable of “X”:Table 5 the frequency of “X”Semantically, nominal constituents that want to be an “X” are requested to have description meaning and are often both a noun and an adjective:(15)科学从干旱沙漠之中找到了水资源, 这不是奇迹中的奇迹吗?It was a miracle of miracle to find water in desert.“奇迹”(miracle) also means descriptively “out of the common”: 【奇迹】想象不到的不平凡的事情。Thus, “奇迹中的奇迹” emphases from non-trivial to a great degree. In cases like (14) ,“梦”(dream) represent “unreal”, “unbelievable”, “void”, “ 梦 中 的 梦 ” indicates something is false or fake.It should be noted that “X zhong de X” has the similar limitation of “X” like “hen(很)+ noun” structure, they both need to manifest descriptive meaning. Some of these compounds have adjectival morpheme themselves, e.g. “精品、奇迹、悲剧、热 点”; some of them can be modified by “hen”, e.g. “很男人、很悲剧”. Unlike “hen+noun” in which the noun is not referential but used to modify and describe and works as in the position of adjective (Shi Chunhong, 2001, 2002), “X zhong de X” construction has a referential noun, thus words like “基础学科” can enter into “X zhong de X” but not into “hen+noun”. On the contrary, “很中国”is correct, “中 国中的中国”is hard to be found, because proper noun directing some individuals cannot express “category”. One correct case is “雷锋中的雷锋”,in which “雷锋” is    
not only a proper noun, but also a group of people who do good thing for nothing like Lei Feng.“X” can be a noun referring to jobs or status, which manifests one typical member of the group: (16)布雷 ̇丹尼斯被称为“魔术师中的 魔术师”,在其魔术生涯中曾获许多国际 比赛大奖。Breay is called the magician of magicians.(17)在帕尔斯素有"战士中的战士"之称 的达龙又被异国的士兵们封了一个新的 称号。Daron knows as the fighter of fighters in Pals.In the two cases above, Breay is an excellent magician, and Daron is an excellent fighter, both of them are the outstanding ones in their field. Also, nouns like “党员、干部、专家、作家、导演、 警察、教师、博士” often tend to be seen as higher level in society, they can be chosen as an “X”, but lower status like farmer, worker or student cannot enter into “X zhong de X” construction, for there is no “remarkable”, “crackajack” or “prominent” feature in these words. So we can say only occupations that are perceived as important and have a relative higher social status, or maybe they are hard to get, thus need to experience a rigorous assessment, for this reason people look up high of those people and the recursion of greatness can be established. Pustejovsky (2001, 2006) called them “artifactual type” (Song Zuoyan, 2015), whose function meaning is dramatically manifested after being an “X”, e.g. “魔术师中的魔术师”,highlights the magician has a wonderful performing skills.3.3 Other word class of “X”Adjective acts as “X”:(18)如果不是偶然中的偶然,幸运中的 幸运,这个受害人死几次也够了。Thanks to the accident of accidents, the good fortune of good fortune, otherwise the victim had already died.Due to an extremely good fortune, the victim didn’t die.(19)又把不要感情装扮得堂而皇之,这 便是矫情中的矫情。Don’t be so hypocritical in sentiment as the fake of the fake.Don’t be so hypocritical and so fake in sentiment.(20)嫦娥把这院里对她的排斥,总想成 是必然中的必然。Chang O often thought the exclusion as a must of the must.Chang O often thought the exclusion as something that is inevitable.(21)解这道方程式关系我军科研的动向, 这可是绝密中的绝密啊!Solving this equation, which indicates the tendency of our army, is the secret of the secret. Solving this equation, which indicates the tendency of our army, is super-secret.“A zhong de A” indicates “very A”, in which the adjective was deprived of the referential feature by Zhu(2013), but we argue that “X” is apt to nouns, which explains the referential property of this position, and A tends to be nominal within this position“. 偶然中的偶然” in fact refers to accidental events. If a word is both a noun and a adjective, its noun feature is expressed here, e.g. “意外中的意外”. Moreover, “zhong” and “de” imply that “A” is similar to nouns. As for phonology, only double syllable adjective are correct, monosyllable can only appear in structure like“XzhongzhiX”, e.g. “难中之难”, or    
fixed into “难中难”, and used in classical style of writing.“X” is a verb:(22)木乃伊既然出现了,卡特便进行一 项极不平凡的作业——可谓发掘中的发 掘,“掘”穿一层又一层的包布。The discovered mummy request Cart to conduct an unordinary task of “peeling the mummy”, which can be called digging in digging.The discovered mummy request Cart to conduct an unordinary task of “peeling the mummy”, which need to do a lot disinterment.(23)当然,也可能是暗算中的暗算,狡 猾中的狡猾。Of course it is a plot in plot, cunning and cunning.Of course it is very secret and cunning.(24)只鼓吹形式革新,这纯粹是扯淡中 的扯淡。Only preaching revolution formally is absolutely talking the nonsense of nonsense.Only preaching revolution formally is absolutely nonsense.Here we get “发掘 (dig-spare no effort, deep)”, “暗算 (plot in secret-secret)”and “ 扯 淡 (nonsense-not useful) ” both of which show strong descriptive meaning.4 The feature of construction meaning of “X zhong de X”“X zhong de X” construction is a recursion of magnitude expressed by echo, it embodies metrizablility, uncertainty and subjectivity.4.1 MetrizabilityIn most cases, the “X” in “X zhong de X” construction is a descriptive noun, whichhas the feature of adjective. So we say they are provided with metriablility:(25)手机销售中存在问题较多,成为电 信投诉热点中的热点。Sales of cell phones has many problems, thus become the hot spot of hot spots.Sales of cell phones has many problems and is extremely hot.(26)与 “穷人中的穷人”不同,村基 金小组向所有村民开放。Unlikely, the foundation of the village was opened to every villager instead of the poorest of the poorest.Unlikely, the foundation of the village was opened to every villager instead of the poorest in the village.(27)当年的中苏关系,对于两国,对于世 界,都是政治中的政治,微妙而敏感。 Sino-Soviet relations in those years were the polity that exerts a tremendous influence, i.e. subtle and sensitive with regard to both the two counties and the world.Sino-Soviet relations in those years were polity of polity, i.e. subtle and sensitive with regard to both the two counties and the world.These four cases above are different from the way of realizing the metrizability. (25) has adjectival morpheme “hot”, as for how hot it is, it can be described as a continuum. (26) talks about poor people: that depends on how poor it is. “politics” has property description as a whole, and “很热点,很政 治” can be used.The variant of “X zhong de X” change a little where the second “X” can have a prepositive modifier, e.g. “英雄中的超级 英雄”.4.2 Uncertainty
When “X” is an adjective or has adjectival morpheme, “X zhong de X” has a clear and core construction meaning, e.g.“偶然中的 偶然”、“悲剧中的悲剧”、“胡扯中的胡扯”. When “X” expresses other nouns, semantic dissemination is of uncertainty. For example, “女人中的女人”display a woman with a typical figure, but what exactly a typical woman is still remains uncertain unless we obtain the context in discourse: (28)郑明明善良、聪慧、执著、柔中带 刚,是公认的女人中的女人,女人中的魅 力女人。Zheng Mingming is nice, smart, tough, soft but strong, who knowns as “woman in women”. Zheng Mingming is nice, smart, tough, soft but strong, who knowns as a typical woman.(29)拍完戏后,她与性格刚烈的王姬成 了非常好的朋友,好得王姬开玩笑说,晓 频是女人中的女人。After acting, Xiao Pin became a good friend to Wang Ji, who has a strong personality. Wang said Xiao Pin is a “woman in women”.After acting, Xiao Pin became a good friend to Wang Ji, who has a strong personality. Wang said Xiao Pin is a warm and mild in personality.(30)你别看她小,那是穿了衣服,而外 表也故意装得那个样子,等她跟你上了床, 你就会发现,她不但是个女人,而且是女 人中的女人。Although she looks slim in normal times, she is a “woman in women” when sleeping with somebody.Although she looks slim, she is quite sexy.An other example is (31), in which we would hardly get to know what is an “industry in the industry”, until we know its origin of Liechtenstein’s industry export-oriented economic structure, and it is essential for it to develop foreign enterprises.(31)在列支敦士登还有工业中的工业, 也就是引进外国企业。It is an industry of industry in Liechtenstein, i.e. foreign enterprises.4.3 Subjectivity“X zhong de X” construction often represents a subjective evaluation, here the connotation of “X” bears strong sense of social identity: (32)在楼盘销售员中,高档公寓的售楼 小姐是“贵族中的贵族”。Those who sells high-end flat are the aristocrat of aristocrat among sales staffs.Those who sells high-end flat are most noble and proud among sales staffs.(32) reflects that “aristocrat” has gained the image of rich, proud and arrogant, as well as superfluous rules and usages, among our community. Likely, “泥土中的泥土”、“英 雄中的英雄”also have cultural and social background as they enter into this language construction.5 Comparing with relative structuresBesides “X zhong de X”, “hen X(很 X)”“bi X hai yao X(比X还要X)”“X jiu shi X (X 就是 X)” are all special structure with idiosyncrasy that cannot be read from its form. Their similarity is “X” prefers adjective-liked noun whose connotation is descriptive. They belong to one “construction group”. They share the similar metrizablility, uncertainty and subjectivity and they are prone to be use in colloquialism.They are different in form and function. “X zhong de X”, “hen X” , “bi X hai yaoX” are involved in category match, “X jiu shi X” is a tautologous structure which uses echo to
activate descriptive semantic feature. The “女人就是软弱”. second “X” can replace into a predicate, e.g.       “X zhong de X”   “hen X”   “bi X hai yao X”    “X jiu shi X”   e.g. X = woman  女人中的女人  很女人  比女人还要 女人   女人 就是女人   Word class of X  X can be nouns, adjectives and verbs(rarely), they are referencial, and the proper noun has been generalized  Can be proper nouns,other nouns and adjectives  Can be proper noun      Function of XBoth are referential: first category, second individual  Nominal changes to descriptive First is referential, second is descriptive First is referential, second is descriptiveTable 6 Comparison of “X zhong de X”, “hen X”,“bi X hai yao X” and “X jiu shi X”6 ConclusionThis paper discussed the feature and function of “X zhong de X” construction by analyzing corpus and statistics, and made a comparison with “hen X”, “bi X hai yao X” and “X jiu shi X”.“X zhong de X” is mainly used to highlight a certain typical feature of individual among its assemblage. It mainly serves as object to “Yes” word, sometimes subject or appositive attribute. “X” is mostly a nominal constituent with strong descriptive meaning, nouns of vocation and status, and some adjectives and verbs can also enter into this construction, while double syllable is more common. Metrizablility, uncertainty andsubjectivity are its main properties. Comparing with other relative structures, “X zhong de X” is more typical as a construction, and its descriptive meaning is brought by the construction itself, not by the referential “X”.ReferenceGoldberg, A.E. 1995.
