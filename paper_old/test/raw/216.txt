When Embodiment Meets Generative Lexicon: The Human Body Part Metaphors in Sinica CorpusAbstractThis research aims to integrate embodiment with generative lexicon. By analyzing the metaphorically used human body part terms in Sinica Corpus, the first balanced modern Chi- nese corpus, we reveal how these two theories complement each other. Embodiment strengthens generative lexicon by spelling out the cognitive reasons which underlies the pro- duction of meaning, and generative lexicon, specifically the qualia structure, complements embodiment by accounting for the reason un- derlying the selection of a particular body part for metaphorization. Discussing how the four body part terms—血 xie “blood”, 肉 rou “flesh”, 骨 gu “bone”, 脈 mai “meridian”— behave metaphorically, this research argues that the visibility and the telic role of the qua- lia structure are the major reasons motivating the choice of a body part to represent a com- paratively abstract notion. The finding ac- counts for what constrains the selection of body parts for metaphorical uses. It also facili- tates the prediction of the behavior of the four body part terms in these uses, which can func- tion as the starting point to examine whether the two factors—visibility and telicity—also motivate the metaphorization of the rest hu- man body parts.1 IntroductionHuman body is an important medium through which people understand the world. It is throughChu-Ren HuangDepartment of Chinese and Bilingual StudiesThe Hong Kong Polytechnic University 11 Yuk Choi Road, Hong Kong  churen.huang@polyu.edu.hkthe interaction between the human body and the environment that people make sense of what they perceive, with which they conceive. Body part terminology, therefore, is used extensively to rep- resent a variety of things, ranging from the physi- cal surroundings, time, situations, to a person’s emotion, temperament, behavior, etc. (e.g. Gibbs, 2006; Kovecses, 2002; Li, 2015). This is embodi- ment, which demonstrates how body part terms are used metaphorically. While embodiment provides cognitive reasons which underlies meaning pro- duction (e.g. Yu, 2003, 2007) and serves as the foundation of conceptual metaphor understanding and interpretation (e.g. Lakoff and Johnson, 1980, 1999; Johnson, 2008), it does not account for ex- actly what triggers the metaphorical use of a corpo- real term, or what constrains the selection of a body part term to represent a comparatively ab- stract concept.In order to answer this question, this research in- tegrates the theory of embodiment, a key concept in cognitive linguistics, with the theory of Genera- tive Lexicon (Pustejovsky, 1991, 1995), of which we focus on the qualia structure, by analyzing the lexical items containing body part terms in Sinica Corpus (Chen et al., 1996). Embodiment tackles how and where meaning arises, but it falls short in explaining what triggers the selection of a body part to represent an abstract notion. Generative lexicon functions as a way to study the representa- tions and relations of meanings, but it lacks the explanation for the source of meanings. The inte- gration of both, which has not been found in previ- 
ous research, in the analysis of the corporeal meta- phors in corpus data allows us to account for the cognitive motivation of body metaphors and to represent these metaphors by the qualia structure. More importantly, the combination of the two the- ories enables us to find out the motivation underly- ing the choice of certain human body parts for metaphorical uses.2 Theoretical Background, Research Questions and Hypotheses2.1 EmbodimentEmbodiment, or the embodied theory of meaning by Johnson (2008), is proposed as a counterargu- ment against mind-body dualism, a key concept of the Western philosophy and epistemology (Lakoff and Johnson, 1999). The Western tradition has re- garded mind and body as distinct entities, which are independent of each other and cannot be inte- grated. The proposal of embodiment, arguing against the dualist view of knowledge in the West, claims that body and mind should be regarded as continuity (e.g. Johnson, 1987, 2008). Its central tenet is how people make sense of their experienc- es in the world lies in their interaction between their bodies and the environment. The meaning emerging from the corporeal experiences further- more form the basis for people to understand ab- stract concepts. The human body and body parts, during the process of people’s acquisition of knowledge and meaning, are involved and function as indispensable media. What the physical side goes through describe what the mental side con- ceives, and the mental states are instantiated by the physical states/actions. In a word, embodiment is to map the concrete body and/or body part(s) onto abstract concepts that are difficult to under- stand/convey so as to facilitate communication.Previous studies on embodiment (e.g. Yu, 2009, 2011) focus on the identification of the human body and body parts used in the mappings, ex- plaining how human body (parts) is/are activated for the conceptualization of abstract ideas. Despite the explanation of how the corporeal level influ- ences the conceptual level, embodiment suffers a limitation it: it does not explain why the human body and/or body parts are chosen to represent ab- stract notions? To answer this question, we think visibility of the body part is consequential. Moreo-ver, the supplementation of the qualia structure within the generative lexicon also helps us find out the answer.2.2 Generative LexiconThe generative lexicon (Pustejovsky, 1991, 1995) addresses the richness of word meanings. Tackling the creative use of words and the issues of compo- sitionality of lexical items, it proposes four levels of representation connected by mechanisms of se- lection. Among the four levels—argument struc- ture, event structure, qualia structure, and lexical inheritance structure (Pustejovsky, 1995: 61)— qualia structure accounts for the semantic richness of a lexical item in a construction, based on which. Based on the qualia structure, concepts in the world are composed of at least the following four roles:(1) The constitutive role, which concerns the rela- tion between an object and its constituents or parts;(2) The formal role, which distinguishes the object within a larger domain;(3) The telic role, which reveals the purpose and function of the object;(4) The agentive role, which explains the factors bringing about an object.The constitutive and formal roles provide the descriptive information of an object. The telic and agentive roles, not directly referring to the object, present the embodiment information of the object at issue, as they represent eventive dimensions which indicate the interaction between the object and human beings, i.e. how it functions to people and how it is brought into being.The application of the qualia structure facilitates us to extrapolate why the human body or a specific body part is activated in the representation of an abstract notion. The quales, specifically the telic and agentive roles, help us find out the reason mo- tivating the mappings, and furthermore make pre- diction about what body part(s) is/are to be chosen in other mappings. Combining embodiment with the generative lexicon, this research aims to enrich the embodiment and conceptual metaphor theory with a more sophisticated view brought about by the generative lexicon. Analyzing the metaphorical use of body parts, we will testify that human body
parts are not treated as equal in embodiment. In- stead, specific body parts are chosen, and the ra- tionale behind the choices can be explained and predicted with the application of the qualia struc- ture within the generative lexicon.2.3 Research Questions and HypothesesThis research aims to find the answers to the fol- lowing two questions:(1) How do embodiment and the generative lexi-con interact? Does the qualia role influence the metaphorical use of the body part terms? Or does the metaphorical use of the body part terms facilitate the retrieval of the qualia role?(2) What is the significance of the qualia structure in constraining the selection of a body part for metaphorical use?This research is built on the following hypothe- ses:(1)We hypothesize that the generative lexicon and embodiment complement each other: the gener- ative lexicon strengthens embodiment by providing a way to explain the selection of a particular body part for metaphorization. Em- bodiment enhances the generative lexicon by providing the cognitive reasons which underlies the production of meaning (Huang et al., 2013; Huang and Hsieh, forthcoming).(2)Among the five faculties employed by human beings to interact with the world—vision, hear- ing, smell, taste and touch—we hypothesize vi- sion is consequential. That is, the visibility of human body parts is important for the selection of a body part to be used metaphorically.(3) Among the four roles of the qualia structure, the telic role, referring to the purpose and function of body parts, is predicted to be the most pro- ductive in the representations of body meta- phors.3 Data and Method 3.1 DataThe corpus data under analysis come from Sinica Corpus, short for Academia Sinica Balanced Cor- pus of Modern Chinese used in Taiwan (Chen et al., 1996). It is the first balanced modern Chinese cor- pus with part of speech tagging and has been em-ployed for a variety of research ranging from the core fields such as morphology, syntax, semantics (e.g. Liu, 2002; Myers et al., 2006; Tseng, 2001), to applied fields such as discourse analysis, com- putational linguistics, and cognitive linguistics (e.g. Huang, 2000; Huang et al., 2002). The corpus data are culled from different topics/themes: philosophy (8%), science (8%), society (38%), art (5%), life (28%), and literature (13%) (http://rocling.iis.sinica.edu.tw/CKIP/engversion/2 0corpus.htm).3.2 MethodWe choose to analyze the four atypical body parts: 血, 肉, 骨, 脈, each of which is defined by the online dictionary compiled by the Ministry of Edu- cation, Taiwan (MOE Dictionary) as1血 xie “blood”: “The red fluid in the veins/vessels of higher organisms, which starts from the heart and circulates throughout the body. It functions to carry nutrients and wastes so as to conduct metabolism.”肉 rou “flesh”: “The soft part of an animal’s body which encloses bones. E.g., flesh.”骨 gu “bone”: “.”脈 mai “meridian”: “The blood vessels,distributed all over the human body and animal body, carry blood everywhere.” However, following the traditional Chinese medicine, we think the concept of 脈 should be regarded as part of the body in which life-sustaining substances are held through, rather than merely the blood vessels in anatomy. The substances circulating through the meridians are both visible and invisible, the former of which is blood and the latter 氣 qi “energy”These four atypical body parts are chosen for the following reasons:(1) They are not typical body parts. Unlike e.g. 手shou “hand”, 腳 jiao “foot”, 肝 gan “liver”, 肺 fei “lung”, of which the boundaries are definedmore clearly, these four parts of the body have no clear boundaries. Instead, they are “exten- sive” and compose a large proportion of the human body.(2) They are intertwined with each other. One1 The definitions of the four body parts are translated by the authors.The frame inside the body of an animal which supports the body  
functions to form another, e.g. flesh forms blood vessels, the tangible part of the meridi- an; one carries another, e.g. blood vessels, part of meridian, carry blood; one manufactures another, e.g. bone (marrow) manufactures blood. These four parts of the body are so in- tertwined, which we assume will be reflected in their metaphor uses.(3) According to the definition, 血 xie “blood”, 骨 gu “bone”, and 肉 rou “flesh” are more em- bodied, while 脈 mai “meridian” is less so, as it involves an imagined part, i.e. the conduit circulating 氣 qi “energy”. Comparing these four body parts reveals that the more embodied a body part is, the more easily we can predict its behavior, and vice versa.Identifying metaphorically used wordWe examine whether the lexical items consisting of body part terms are used metaphorically in the corpus. At this step, we modify the metaphor iden- tification procedure (MIP) proposed by the Prag- glejaz Group (2007) so that it better works for Chinese texts. The modification mainly involves (1) The determination of the basic contemporarymeaning of a lexical unit, and(2) The analysis of the body part terminology incompounds of differing morphological struc- tures.The reason for the modification lies in the fact that the lexical items containing corporeal words in Sinica Corpus are mostly compounds, which are composed of a body part term with another/other word(s). The basic contemporary meaning thus cannot be determined based on a compound as a whole. Instead, the body part terms need to be ex- tracted and examined on their own so as to reveal how these terms behave in the compound. The ra- tionale behind this modified step is, when a word forms part of a compound, it usually undergoes metaphorical/metonymical extensions, except that it is part of a coordination structured compound.Take the lexical item 血緣 xieyuan, which is a compound containing the body part 血 xie “blood”. In the MOE dictionary, 血緣 is defined as 血統上 的關係 xietong shang de guanxi “relations byblood”. If the definition is taken as the basic con- temporary meaning, this lexical item is consideredliteral. In our modified MIP, we take the unit or morpheme 血 xie “blood” out of the compound 血 緣 xieyuan “relations by blood” and examine the semantic change occurring to the body part in the compound. In other words, considering 血, and other body part terms, as a lexical unit in com- pounds, we examine the basic contemporary mean- ing of these body part terms and their behavior in compounds.The basic contemporary meaning of the unit 血 xie “blood” found in the MOE dictionary is “The red fluid in the veins/vessels of higher organisms, which starts from the heart and circulates through- out the body. It functions to carry nutrients and wastes so as to conduct metabolism”. In the com- pound 血緣 xieyuan “relations by blood”, 血 xie “blood” does not simply refer to the body fluid which sustains life. Instead, it has undergone se- mantic extension. The unit 血 xie “blood” refers to the genetic traits or ancestral tie carried by this flu- id. It is the genetic/ancestral tie embedded in blood which forms the relations of a group of people. 血 xie “blood” in 血緣 xieyuan “relations by blood” is thus treated as a metaphorical expression.Once we identify a metaphorically used lexical unit, we need to formulate how it behaves in the metaphor. We propose to incorporate the qualia structure, which provides more information for the metaphorically used word and helps us formulate metaphors, as elaborated below.Retrieving qualia rolesIn order to find out the constraints underlying the selection of a body part term in a metaphor, we incorporate the qualia structure, through which we retrieve the qualia role(s) of the body part(s) in the corpus data. We expand the method proposed by Song and Zhao (2013a, 2013b), as we focus on two levels: the qualia role of a body part term at the lexical and clausal levels. In brief,(1) We first examine whether there is more than one sense of the body part at issue. E.g. in the corpus data, two senses are found in 血 xie “blood”:Sense 1 refers to the liquid circulating natural- ly inside human body, and sense 2 to the liq- uid flowing inside/out of human body due to injury or effort making.(2) We spell out the qualia structure, i.e. the four
roles, of the body part at issue according to the sense(s) found in step (1). For example, the qualia structures of the two senses of 血 xie “blood” is shown below:Sense 1Constitutive=...Formal= liquid, redTelic= sustain life, carry ancestral features, carry emotion and personal traits, etc. Agentive: Natural kindSense 2Constitutive=...Formal=liquid, red, smell, coagulation Telic=...Agentive=X which causes blood to flow out of body/body parts(3) We examine the behavior of the body part term in a lexical form and see whether a specific role is highlighted.(4) We then go beyond the lexical level into the clausal level to find out the role(s) of the body part which is/are specified at the clausal level.We compare the role(s) specified at the lexical and clausal levels, and derive three kinds of mean- ing representations:(1) The lexical item with a specified role at thelexical level and the word’s metaphoricalmeaning is lexically accessed.(2) The lexical item with a specified role at thelexical level but the word’s metaphoricalmeaning is NOT lexically accessed.(3) The lexical item with NO specified role at the lexical level and the word’s metaphoricalmeaning is NOT lexically accessed.We argue that the three representations of the words consisting of a body part term reveal a point not addressed in previous research on embodiment: the layeredness and inter-connectedness of the meaning extensions of body parts, which strength- ens the human body as a whole in the embodiment process.The hierarchy of visibilityWe propose a hierarchy of visibility of the four body parts. We think 血 xie “blood” is the most visible, because it is the only body part among the four that most speakers have the experience of vis- ualizing, as bleeding of small amounts of blood is acommon human experience. On the other hand, seeing (human) bone or flesh requires traumatic unusual events, and meridian is comparatively ab- stract among the four, as it consists of not only the tangible but also the imagined parts.We believe visibility is linguistically significant; i.e. the visibility of a body part is reflected in its collocation with visual verbs, the number of com- pounds and compounds indicating visibility. We thus examine (1) the construction of 見 jian “see” X (e.g. 見骨 jiangu “see the bone”) and看 kan “see” and/or 見 jian “see”...X (e.g. *看 kan “see”...骨 gu “bone”; 看見 kanjian “see”...骨 gu “bone”) in the corpus,2 (2) all the types of compounds with the four body parts as components, regardless of the metaphoricity and morphological structure. These compounds may come into the form com- prising the body part term followed/preceded by one, two, or three characters.4 ResultsTable 1 shows the four body parts in the construc- tions of 見 jian “see” X, and 看 kan “see” and/or 見 jian “see”...X. There are 15 tokens of 見血 jianxie “see blood”, all of which occur as part of the fixed idiom 一針見血 yizhenjianxie, which metaphorically means “hit the nail (right) on the head; right on target”, but none of 見骨 jiangu “see the bone”, *見肉 jianrou “see flesh”, and *見脈 jianmai “see meridians” can be found. We then examine the construction 看 kan “see” and/or 見 jian “see”...X. The token numbers of the 看 kan “see” and/or 見 jian “see”...血 xie “blood” still tops, followed by 看 kan “see” and/or 見 jian “see”...肉 rou “flesh”, 看 kan “see” and/or 見 jian “see”...骨 gu “bone”, and no token is found in 看 kan “see” and/or 見 jian “see”...脈 mai “meridian”. Calculating the percentage of these two construc- tions against the total token numbers of 見 jian “see” X and X as a morpheme word, we have found the constructions with 血 xie “blood” pre- sents the highest percentage (9.22%), followed by those with 骨 gu “bone” (2.27%), 肉 rou “flesh” (0.94%), and 脈 mai “meridian” (0%), upon which the hierarchy of visibility of the four body parts is2 看 kan “see” and 見 jian “see” are chosen because they rep- resent the most common visual verbs.

That is, we exam- ine how each of the four body parts behaves in the compounds of the following patterns:X 血 xie “blood”, 血 xie “blood” XX 肉 rou “flesh”, 肉 rou “flesh” XX 骨 gu “bone”, 骨 gu “bone”XX 脈 mai “meridian”, 脈 mai “meridian”XWe go through all the clauses/sentences with these eight patterns of compounds, and check whether they are metaphorically used. To clearly present the interplay between the compounds and the metaphorically used body part terms, when a compound is assigned different types of meta- phoricity, the compound is numbered according to number of types. Example 1 indicates the three types of metaphoricity of 血 xie “blood” in the co- ordinated compound 血脈 xiemai “blood (and) meridians”, with the corresponding metaphors en- closed in the brackets.Example 1(1) 彷彿__根本__不__是__與__我們__血脈__相連__的__孩子 (FAMILY IS BLOOD) As-if__fundamental__NEG__SHI__and__we__ blood-meridian__connect__DE__children ...as if they were not our children.(2) 不期然而然__地,我__立刻__血脈__賁張, 坐立難安。(EMOTION IS BLOOD)Unexpectedly__DE, I__immediately__blood- meridian__expand, cannot-sit-or-stand Unexpectedly, I got hot immediately and rest- less.   Constructions   血     骨 肉    脈    見X          15        0    0        0   看 and/or 見...X       5        1    2     0   Total token of 見 X    15     0   0   0  Total token of X (morpheme word)   202  44213  24   Percentage       9.22%      2.27%    0.94%     0%  Table1.

We then calculate the ratio be- tween the number of the types indicating the visual perceptibility against those of all the compounds and make Table 2.Body part  Number of types of all compounds (A)    Number of types of compounds indicating visibility (B) Ratio (B/A)    血 compounds  152    65 42.76%    骨 compounds  124    15 12.10%    肉 compounds   130      8  6.15%      脈 compounds 47  1 2.13%  Table 2.

This is not a one- on-one correlation, as a type of metaphorical use may be encoded in more than one qualia role. It is thus not feasible to show the percentage of each qualia role. Instead, we compare the number of each qualia role in each compounding pattern. E.g. for Sense 2 of 血 xie “blood” X, the agentive role is more dominant than the formal role, as there are 8 occurrences of the former but only 3 hits of the latter. The inspection of the qualia roles across all the compound types shows that the telic role pre- dominates in motivating the metaphors with the body parts as the source concept, except Sense 2 of 血 xie “blood” X, Sense 2 of X 血 xie “blood”, and Sense 2 of X 骨 gu “bone”, in which the agentive role predominates.5 ConclusionBy incorporating embodiment with the generative lexicon, specifically the qualia structure, in the analysis of metaphors involving four atypical body parts in a balanced corpus, we have demonstrated that the visibility and the telic role of the body part are two major reasons constraining the selection of body parts for metaphorical uses. The finding not only accounts for the constraints which underlie the selection, but also facilitates the prediction of the behavior of the four body part terms in these uses. That is, the higher the visibility a body part is, the more possible it is to be employed metaphori- cally. Moreover, the telic role of a body part pre- dominantly motivates the use of a body part as the source concept in a metaphor. With our finding as the starting point, for the future study, we will ex- amine whether the two factors—visibility and telicity—also motivate the metaphorization of the rest human body parts in corpus data.AcknowledgementThis research is supported by Project No. G-UB68, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University.
