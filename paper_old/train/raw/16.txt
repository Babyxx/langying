Using Twitter Data to Infer Personal Values of Japanese ConsumersAbstractOur purpose is to use Twitter data to infer per- sonal values in marketing for Japanese con- sumers. In this paper, we reintroduce our per- sonal value system and apply the model for in- ferring personal values with tweets. To adapt the model to the rapid change of wording in tweets, we propose a dynamic model based on time-weighted frequency in this research. We evaluated the prediction results from our previous approach, newly proposed approach (the dynamic model), and other methods with 10-fold cross-validation. Our experiment re- sults show that personal values can be inferred from Twitter data, and our approach based on Bayesian network performs well with skewed training data.1 IntroductionIn marketing science, personal values have been considered the central determinants of consumer be- havior. They are widely used for market segmenta- tion and behavioral prediction. VALS (Values And Lifestyles) is a personal value system for market segmentation,1 and (Wu, 2005) reconstructed it for Chinese consumers as China-Vals. Similarly, we developed a value system for Japanese consumers based on the AIO (Activities, Interests, and Opin- ions) (Plummer, 1974) rating statement during last two years. We gathered about 20,000 Japanese con- sumers’ personal values data via questionnaires, and filled the value system database with this data.1VALS is developed by Mitchell, Arnold (May 1984) in the book Nine American Lifestyles: Who We Are and Where We’re Going.Yasuo TanidaSynergy Marketing, Inc.

On the other hand, a data mining approach like microblog anal- ysis, which is considered to have a sampling bias problem, as checked by (Mislove et al., 2011), can get objective “answers” for the “questions” without subjective biases. Hence, a microblog mining ap- proach, like mining tweets, may be a complement to the questionnaire approach. Moreover, (Chen et al., 2014) pointed out that word use may be influenced by values, and made an effort to analyze the associ- ations between personal values and their word uses in social media. In our research, we use Twitter for a data mining approach to infer personal values, be- cause we consider that users on Twitter tend to tweet their real intentions with limited impersonation.In our previous work, we proposed a model for extracting personal values from tweets with text mining technologies. This model demonstrated that we were able to predict consumer behavior with tweets and our value system. As a result, we applied it to marketing consulting and social contribution for trial-and-error. However, the wording on Twit- ter changes frequently, and the keywords used for inference in this model may be out of date. Hence, in this research, we propose a dynamic model which can update itself automatically. In addition, a de- tailed methodological comparison between our pro- posed model and other methods is discussed from the experiment results. 
2 Methodology2.1 A Value System for Japanese ConsumersTo determine the latent benefits and interests of Japanese consumers, we proposed a value system for Japanese people during previous two years. The system contains 61 components (value component, VC) covering 8 frames of personal values extracted from 20,000 questionnaires with principal compo- nent analysis (PCA). However, an abbreviated and more flexible version of this system with 22 compo- nents (mini version) was preferred to use, because the questionnaire of mini version has only 60 ques- tions as opposed to 303 questions for the full ver- sion. Table 1 shows details of the 22 components above. The instance of each component can be a bi- nary value (i.e., 0 or 1). In addition, we defined 12 social types named Societas from full version with Ward’s method, and trained the Societas Model with the Bayesian network (Pearl, 1985). We also take the word Societas in the wide sense of the value sys- tem we proposed.a TwitterSocietas Model with Bayesian network and the training data is extracted as follows.1. ObtainSocietasvalues(miniversion)andTwit- ter id via questionnaires. Then, make a unique word set W from tweets of all users, and refine W with a DF(document frequency, we treat each Twitter user’s tweets as a document) be- tween 10% and 90%.2. Calculate importance scores for each <word, VC> paired with the following formula.|P(w∈Wi|Vj =1)−P(w∈Wi|Vj =0)|Where, Wi represents the unique word set ex- tracted from Twitter user i, Vj represents the binary set of value component j for all users calculated from the questionnaires, and w is the word in W .3. For each value component, sort the importance score pairs decreasingly, and extract the top 30 words as the feature keywords (speech key- word) of the value component.4. For each <speech keyword, VC> pair, calcu- late the relevant coefficients by Algorithm 1.5. Calculate the binary data (speech component, SC) of speech keywords for each value compo- nent with the relevant coefficients as: ⃗f(SC)= 1 ifkw·p⃗ca−p ̄ca>0 (1)0 otherwise⃗Where kw represents the vector of speech key-word appearance in Twitter user’s vocabulary Wi, p⃗ca represents the relevant coefficient(i.e., pca1 or pca2 in Algorithm 1), and p ̄ca is the mean for all Twitter users.6. Merge speech components and values compo- nents into the training data of TwitterSocietas Model IN the format of <SC1 for VC1, SC2 for VC1, SC1 for VC2, ..., VC1, VC2>Notice that only the approach of inferring 22 value components is mentioned here because these components can be seen as the characteristics of 12 social types.   Frame Name Component Name  Character Curiosity, Delicacy, Laxity, Cooperativeness  Positive Narcissism, Self-realization  Negative Sensitivity to criticism, Sen- sitivity to lack of common sense, Sensitivity to disap- pointment  Human relationship Stress, Friendship emphasiz- ing  Family relationship Marriage aspiration, Spousal responsibility as housewife, Family discord  Sense of job Satisfaction, Stress  Sense of money Lack of money, Savings, Suf- ficiency  Sense of time Priority to family, Sufficiency, Lack of time         Table 1: The detail of 22 value components in the mini version of Societas.2.2 Societas Inference with Twitter DataModel Our previous work proposed a model called TwitterSocietas for inferring Societas values from Twitter data. We made an effort to construct
 Algorithm 1 Relevant coefficients generation. Input: speech keywords KW for value component j , word set {W C } for all tweets, and the binaryset Vj of value component j. Output: Relevant coefficients data.W 1(w, t) is a function to calculate the weight of word w for Twitter user t. Where i repre- sents the newness of tweet, i.e., f (w, i) in (2) is related to the latest tweet of user t when i equals to 1. f (w, i) is the relative frequency of word w in user t’s ith newest tweet, and can be calculated as follows.frequency of word w in user t ’s ith newest tweet total frequency of word w in user t ’s all tweetsIn equation (2), C is a constant and N is the amount of tweets for user t. Let C be 2,000 and N ≤ C, i.e., N will be set to 2,000 when the amount of user t’s tweets is more than 2,000. This is because 2,000 tweets are adequate for inferring personal values according to our pre- liminary experiment.• Refine the weighting as follows. 1:2: 3: 4: 5: 6: 7: 8: 9:10:WT ⇐ matrix of length(Twitter users) ∗ 30 elements and initialize all elements to 0 fori=1tolength(Twitterusers)dofor each kw in KW doif KW[k] in WC[i] thenWT[i][kw] ⇐ 1 end ifend for endforpca ⇐ PCA(WT,Vj)return 30 pairs of <pca1, pca2>, where pca1 and pca2 represents the weights of the first prin- ciple component and the second one from pca for each speech keyword.  Inference We use the same approach of step 5 above to generate the evidence from object Twitter data, and the evidence contains 44 speech compo- nents (i.e., each value component has 2 speech com- ponents) in binary. To infer the personal values with 44 speech components, we employ the Loopy Belief Propagation algorithm in (Weiss, 2000) . As a re- sult, the inferred data of value components are prob- abilities so that they can be used more flexibly than binary ones.2.3 A Dynamic TwitterSocietas ModelAs Twitter data is updated frequently, the words used in TwitterSocietas have an aged problem as soon as the tendency of wording in tweets changes. Further- more, we assume that wording changes more fre- quently than personal values, so that recent tweets may be related to users’ personal values more deeply than older ones. Hence, we propose an auto- updating TwitterSocietas Model in which recent tweets are weighted.• Firstly, we define a weight of the words in each tweet as:NW1(w,t)= C−i+1×f(w,i) (2) 1 + w1 W 2(w, t) = 0enumerationif w1 > 0 otherwise (3)of W 1(w, t) inHere, equation (2).w1 is an  i=1C• Take the weight W 2(w, t) calculated by equa- tion (3) instead of word appearance at the for- mula of Step 2 in §2.2 and “1” at line 5 in Al- gorithm 1.⃗• Similarly, we let vector kw in equation (1) ini-tialize with the weights calculated by (3) in- stead of the binary data.3 Experiment 3.1 PreliminaryMorphology Unlike English, Japanese sentences are written in Chinese characters and kana (Japanese alphabet) without delimiters (i.e., space) between words. We used MeCab 2 to tokenize the tweets into words. Moreover, we included List of all page titles in the Japanese Wikipedia3 as an additional dictio- nary into MeCab, in order to solve new named enti- ties (i.e., book name, software name, etc.).2 MeCab is an open-source morphological analyzer software.http://taku910.github.io/mecab/3 http://dumps.wikimedia.org/jawiki/

In addition, we applied LSA (latent semantic analysis) (Deerwester et al., 1990) to the TF-IDF values from Twitter corpus, and reduce the data to 1,000 dimension.Baseline We employed a support vector machine (SVM) approach as the baseline in our experiment.4 Moreover, Naive bayes classifier was employed as an alternative choice for classifying Twitter data.4 According to (McCallum and Nigam, 1998), multi- nomial Naive Bayes (NB) is more suitable for con- text with large vocabulary size, and we considered that our training data (vocabulary size > 10k) fits this condition.Bayesian Network As interpreted in §2, the Bayesian network is employed for our proposed method.5 We experimented the Dynamic Twitter- Societas Model mentioned in §2.3 (DTS). From the preliminary experiment, it was expected that perfor- mance of TwitterSocietas Model would be similar to DTS, however, a DTS method solved the aged prob- lem as mentioned in §2.3. To compare with other methods, we used the means of training data (train- ing means) for discretization. For example, even if a probability of vc = 1 (vc is a value component) is close to 0.0 such as 0.02, its binary discretization can also be 1 when the training means of this component is smaller (i.e., 0.01).4We used Machine learning toolkit scikit-learn in our exper- iment. http://scikit-learn.org/stable/5We used “Bayonet”, a Bayesian network software, to make the Societas and TwitterSocietas models. https://staff. aist.go.jp/y.motomura/bayonet/Table 3: Means of the value components for 1,147 Twitter users.Evaluation Metric We used accuracy (A), preci- sion (P), recall (R), and F-measure (F) with 10-fold cross-validation to evaluate the performance of our proposed method and other methods. We treated the prediction result as the retrieved documents, the training data as the relevant documents, and “1” was the appearance of personal value.3.2 EvaluationResults Three representative personal values (Cu- riosity, Cooperativeness, Savings) were selected for discussion and the evaluation is shown in Table 2. Notice that the results of SVM and NB in Table 2 only involved the words between the DF of 10% and 90% when constructing feature vectors from the words in tweets. This is because keywords used in our proposed method were also extracted in this way as mentioned in §2.2. In addition, we normalized the feature vectors with TF-IDF and LSA for SVM and NB.Comparison From Table 2 we can see that both SVM and NB performed better in terms of accuracy than DTS. However, DTS had better scores of recall and F-measure in cooperativeness and especially in Savings. This is due to the skewed distribution of the value components (i.e., P(V C = 0) >> P(V C = 1)) in our training data as shown in Table 3. DTS  DatasetThe dataset used in our experiment con- sisted of two subsets: Societas data and tweets, both related to 1,147 Twitter users.

Table 4 shows the evaluation re- sults for other personal values that were not shown in Table 2, and we find that a Bayesian Network approach may be not appropriate for inferring the personal values corresponding to accuracy scores in bold font because they are as poor as random guess- ing.4 Discussion4.1 Speech keywordsWe believe that every morphological element rep- resents an aspect of the user’s personal value on Twitter. Hence, dictionary form words without nor- malization are preferred in our research. For ex- ample, to infer personal values, tsumetai is dif- ferent from a variation word use with kaomoji (the Japanese emoticon) like tsumetatt(◦∀◦ ⊂)⊂, and this is similar to the relation between cool and Cooooooooooooooollllllllllllll!!!!!!!!!!!!!! in (Brody and Diakopoulos, 2011). This is an- other interesting characteristic of the TwitterSoci- etas Model, and was also used for sentiment analysis in (Barbosa and Feng, 2010).4.2 Application of TwitterSocietas ModelIn past years, we have succeeded to apply TwitterSo- cietas Model to infer personal values for marketing researches. For example, we explained TV view- ers’ characteristics with personal values inferred by TwitterSocietas Model to a TV program which has no demographic distribution data about it but has many Twitter followers (Fujii et al., 2013).In addition, we succeeded to find the sudden change of personal value “Narcissism” (from a higher probability a lower one) for a blogger, during the period of her mother’s death from Alzheimer’s Disease (Tanida and Tokumi, 2014). For a text min- ing interest, we found that TwitterSocietas Model can also be applied to blog data. And we hope that in the future, we can acquire knowledge from on- line text data with text mining technologies, such as Twitter data or blog data, for giving some mental support to the people with dementia family mem- bers.4.3 Multilinguistic SocietasIn our recent work, we started a project on finding out the relations between text data in “Weibo” (A kind of Chinese microblogs) and personal values. Up to now, we have gathered 1,002 pieces of ef-

How- ever, we found that for Chinese people (especially who use Weibo), some personal values are very dif- ferent from Japanese Twitter users’ ones. Table 5 shows the arithmetic mean of Societas personal val- ues about Weibo users and Japanese Twitter users. As shown in Table 5, Weibo users tend to have the value “Curiosity” than Japanese Twitter users. How- ever, Japanese Twitter users may be more delicate than Weibo users.values which are also essential factors to marketing science and consumer behavior prediction.5.2 Personal values Inference for Twitter usersFor personal value inference, (Quercia et al., 2011) contributed to personality prediction with Twitter profiles based on Big Five. (Golbeck et al., 2011) provided a method to infer Twitter users’ personal- ity of Big Five with the statistics about their accounts and tweets. To infer the personality of Chinese peo- ple, (Bai et al., 2013) developed a method to infer the Big Five personality from “Weibo” data with a multivariate regression approach. In our research, we use the words in tweets to calculate the speech components (as mentioned in §2.2 Step 5) for each user, and these speech components can be used for inferring Societas personal values with TwitterSoci- etas Model. Moreover, we think that personal values are interactive to each other. As a result, we con- structed our TwitterSocietas Model with a Bayesian Network approach.(Sumner et al., 2012) attempted predicting per- sonality traits from the lexicon features extracted tweets. Moreover, (Plank and Hovy, 2015) made an effort on inferring MBTI6 personality type from tweets, gender and some meta-features (i.e., counts of tweets, followers, etc), and showed that so- cial media can provide sufficient linguistic evidence to reliably predict some dimensions of personality. However, they suggested that it is hard to predict the personality dimensions of Judging/Perceiving with the linguistic evidence from tweets. Similarly, as shown in Table 4, we find that some Societas per- sonal values, i.e., “Stress(Human)”, are hard to pre- dict from tweets no matter which classifier is em- ployed.In (Plank and Hovy, 2015), the words in tweets used as lexicon features were transformed into bi- nary word n-grams. In our previous work, we also used the words in binary (whether the words ap- peared in users’ tweets or not), and counted the co-occurrence between Societas personal values and these words, so that we can select sensitive words for each personal value to construct our TwitterSocietas Model. However, in this paper, we incorporated the6MyersBriggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is a way to measure how people perceive the word and make decisions.5 5.1Related WorkDemographic Inference for Twitter usersThe earlier work by (Zamal et al., 2012) proposed an approach of Twitter users’ latent attributes inference including gender, age, and political affiliation with Twitter. Similarly, (Ciot et al., 2013) made an effort to infer gender with non-English-based content and users, and (Bergsma and Durme, 2013) enabled sub- stantial improvements on the task of Twitter gender classification. Moreover, (Beller et al., 2014) pro- posed a method to predict social roles such as doc- tor, teacher, etc. These attributes are considered as demographic attributes, and they are very important to market segmentation. In our research, we con- tributed to the inference of Twitter user’s personal 
relative frequency of words in each tweet as men- tioned in §2.3.6 Conclusion and Future workIn this paper, we introduced our personal value sys- tem and its extension TwitterSocietas. Furthermore, we proposed a dynamic way to update the Twit- terSocietas Model automatically based on Twitter data. We evaluated the performance of the model and compared it with SVM and NB. As a result, we found that our approach accurately inferred personal values with skewed training data.In the future work, we will first check whether the Weibo-Societas Model, a derivation of Twitter- Societas, can be applied to predict personal values of Chinese people. Furthermore, we will try to im- plement the source of Societas personal values infer- ence with other features, such as whether a link or a picture is contained in a tweet, the importance of a mentioned event (i.e., a word after “#” mark).AcknowledgmentsWe wish to thank the anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments and suggestions.ReferencesShuotian Bai, Bibo Hao, Ang Li, Sha Yuan, Rui Gao, and Tingshao Zhu. 2013.
