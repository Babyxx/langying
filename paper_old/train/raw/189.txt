Detecting an Infant’s Developmental Reactions in Reviews on Picture BooksAbstractWe extract the book reviews on picture books written on the Web site specialized in picture books, and found that those reviews reflect in- fants’ behavioral expressions as well as their parents’ reading activities in detail. Analy- sis of the reviews reveals that infants’ reac- tions written on the reviews are coincident with the findings of developmental psychol- ogy concerning infants’ behaviors. In order to examine how the stimuli of picture books induces varieties of infants’ reactions, this pa- per proposes to detect an infant’s developmen- tal reactions in reviews on picture books and shows effectiveness of the proposed method through experimental evaluation.1 IntroductionGenerally, educational books focus on a specific subject to be learned such as science, sociology, etc. Picture books are exceptions, in terms of their effi- ciency for infants’ cognitive developments (Pardeck, 1986) without any intention on specific educational subject with their style of expressions, i.e., funny stories and pictures. Additionally, picture books are outstanding in that those who read them are sepa- rated from those who perceive them. Readers are parents or child care persons who make book talks for infants who do not have sufficient literacy yet. Infants perceive and interpret incoming stimuli of the book talks and the pictures.According to the research in the developmental psychology, infants are found to express variety of cognitive reactions to the external stimuli in accor- dance with their developmental stage. If picturebooks work as those kinds of stimuli, infants might express the cognitive reactions when the stimuli of picture books are perceived. Furthermore, this ten- dency might be amplified, because infants are free from understanding the printing letters of picture books.In order to examine how the stimuli of picture books induces varieties of infants’ reactions, we take an approach of applying a text mining technique to a large amount of the reviews on picture books written by their parents or the childcare persons. More specifically, this paper proposes to detect an infant’s developmental reactions in reviews on pic- ture books and shows effectiveness of the proposed method through experimental evaluation. This paper is the first attempt to solve the task of detecting an infant’s developmental reactions in reviews on pic- ture books.2 The Web Site specialized in Picture BooksTo analyze the infants’ reactions, text data of reviews on picture books are collected from EhonNavi1, the web site specialized in picture books. EhonNavi provides with the information concerning picture books such as publishers, authors, outlines as well as a large amount of reviews written by the parents or child care persons, where the numbers of the titles of the picture books included in EhonNavi amount to about 55,600. The number of the reviews amount to approximately 290,000 as of January 2015 (shown in Table 1). Other than EhonNavi, popular Web sites1http://www.ehonnavi

Out of them, EhonNavi has a unique characteristics in that its reviews tend to be elaborated, reflecting the reactions of those who make book talks as well as those who perceive them. Additionally, it is also the EhonNavi’s characteris- tics that the age of the infant is attached to each re- view. All these characteristics are preferable for our work aiming at detecting the infants’ reactions in ac- cordance with their developmental stages. There- fore, we employ the reviews of EhonNavi for the analysis of this paper.3 Categorization of Descriptions in ReviewsFigure 1 shows an example of the review of Ehon- Navi. As shown in the figure, the header of each review includes the age of the infant to whom the re- viewer reads the picture book. As described above, reviews of EhonNavi include descriptions of book talkers’ reactions, mixed with infants’ reactions. Since reviewers are book talkers in all the cases, in- fants’ reactions described in reviews are those ob- served by reviewers.2http://www.amazon.co.jp 3http://booklog.jpIn order to categorize descriptions in reviews, we randomly picked up 345 reviews from 16 ti- tles of picture books and manually classified de- scriptions in those reviews4. Table 2 shows the re- sult of categorizing descriptions in reviews. Those descriptions are roughly categorized into review- ers’ reactions, infants’ reactions, and descriptions of the story. Reviewers’ reactions are further sub- categorized as shown in the table5. In order to further sub-categorize infants’ reactions, we refer to studies of developmental psychology. In those developmental psychology literatures, they present categories of infants’ cognitive developments in ac- cordance with their ages. Next section introduces those categories of infants’ cognitive developments and analyze the reviews based on them.4The first author of the paper worked on manually catego- rizing descriptions in reviews.5Note that, since each review may include not only one type of reviewers’ reactions but also other type of reviewers’ reac- tions, or both of reviewers’ and infants’ reactions, etc., sum of the frequencies in 345 reviews of 16 titles is more than 345.

 Figure 2: Estimating the Numbers of Infants’ Developmental Reactions4 Categorizing Infants’ Reactions based on Developmental PsychologyAccording to the theory of developmental psychol- ogy, infants express age specific reactions to incom- ing stimuli. We collect such infants’ reactions that are specific to ages ranging from 0 to 3 from pub- lications or papers concerning developmental psy- chology (Sully, 2000; Piaget, 1962; Leslie, 1987; Walker-Andrews and Kahana-Kalman, 1999) and list them in Table 3. In this table, we list those 10 types of reactions in the order of from those ob- served in the early age 0 to those observed in the later age 3. This result indicates that infants at their very early stage of ages tend to react automatically with their physical expression, such as pointing the fingers, or grasping gestures, meanwhile, those at their later stage of ages tend to react consecutivelyexpressing their intention, such as game of make- believe, or asking why, though some reactions are common over multiple ages.Finally, we manually examine those randomly picked up 345 reviews from 16 titles of picture books examined in the previous section and collect typical expressions representing each of the 10 types of infants’ reactions listed in Table 3. Collected ex- pressions are shown on the right hand side column of Table 3.5 Detecting an Infant’s Developmental Reactions in ReviewsThe underlying motivation of this paper is to develop a system for recommending picture books which might induce expected infants’ reactions specified by the users. Considering this motivation, this sec- tion examines whether it is possible to detect an in-
 Figure 3: Frequency Distribution of Infants’ Reactions of the Expression per Age: “gaze at / stare hard / listen hard”fant’s developmental reactions in reviews on picture books.In order to select sample reviews for the analysis, we first collect titles of picture books which have sufficient number of reviews. Here, we rank pic- ture books in descending order of the number of re- views and select the topmost 99 titles, where the to- tal number of the reviews of those 99 titles amount to 27,661. Out of the total 27,661 reviews, we an- alyze those with infants of ages from 0 to 5 years old, which amount to 18,245 reviews, as shown in Table 4. Table 4 also shows the numbers of the ana- lyzed reviews per age.5.1 Estimating the Numbers of Infants’ Developmental ReactionsFor most of the 10 types infants’ reactions as well as their typical expressions listed in Table 3, Fig- ure 2 shows the rate of infants’ reactions within the occurrence of each expression as well as the esti- mated numbers of infants’ developmental reactions. For each of the 10 types of infants’ reactions, the rate of infants’ reactions within the occurrence of its typ- ical expressions is measured by collecting the latest 20 reviews which include one of those typical ex- pressions and then by manually examining whether each of their occurrences actually represents an in- fant’s developmental reaction or not.Also, those estimated numbers of infants’ devel-opmental reactions are calculated by measuring the number of the occurrence of the typical expressions listed in Table 3, and then by multiplying it by the rate of infants’ reactions within the occurrence of each expression.As can be seen from this result, the rates of in- fants’ reactions are relatively low. In the next sec- tion, we propose to detect an infant’s developmental reactions with collocational expressions so that we can improve the rate of infants’ reactions.5.2 Detecting an Infant’s Developmental Reactions in Reviews with Collocational ExpressionsAs typical expressions which represent infants’ de- velopmental reactions and are suitable for the anal- ysis of this paper, out of the 10 types infants’ reac- tions as well as their typical expressions listed in Ta- ble 3, we select “gaze at / stare hard / listen hard”, “imitate”, and “game of make-believe”. According to the studies in developmental psychology (Sully, 2000; Piaget, 1962; Leslie, 1987; Walker-Andrews and Kahana-Kalman, 1999), the infants’ reaction “gaze at / stare hard / listen hard” is mostly ob- served around the age of 1, “imitate” around that of 2, and “game of make-believe” around that of 3. Then, in order to detect an infant’s developmental reactions in reviews on picture books, we propose to collect collocations of each of those three expres-
 Figure 4: Frequency Distribution of Infants’ Reactions of the Expression per Age: “imitate”sions as below and to detect an infant’s developmen- tal reactions represented by those collocational ex- pressions.• For “gaze at / stare hard / listen hard”, we further add pronunciation variation of “gaze at / stare hard / listen hard” as well as expres- sions which are “gaze at / stare hard / listen hard” concatenated with the object “the pic- ture book”.• For “imitate”, we collect “imitate to eat”, “im- itate and”, and “imitation of”.• For “game of make-believe”, we collect “make-believe play” and “train games”.For each of the three expressions “gaze at / stare hard / listen hard”, “imitate”, and “game of make- believe”, Figure 3 to Figure 5 show frequency dis- tribution of infants’ reactions per age. In these fig- ures, total frequencies of those with collocational expressions as well as frequencies of cases other than infants’ reactions are shown. Those frequen- cies are counted by manually judging several hun- dreds matched expressions. From these results, we measure rates of correctly detecting infants’ devel- opmental reactions, which are 94% (“gaze at / stare hard / listen hard”), 77% (“imitate”), and 70% (“game of make-believe”). Thus, it is quite possi-ble to detect an infant’s developmental reactions in reviews on picture books with fairly high precision. Moreover, out of all the occurrences of each ofthe expressions “gaze at / stare hard / listen hard”, “imitate”, and “game of make-believe”, we exam- ine how many of them are actually covered by the collected collocational expressions. We found that those with the collected collocational expressions cover about 50% (“gaze at / stare hard / listen hard”), 60% (“imitate”), and 66% (“game of make- believe”) of their occurrences. Thus, those collected collocational expressions cover fairly large amount of occurrences. Finally, as clearly shown in this re- sult, expressions appearing in reviews of EhonNavi represent infants’ reactions in the way coincident with respective age specific reactions asserted by de- velopmental psychology.6 ConclusionIn order to examine how the stimuli of picture books induces varieties of infants’ reactions, this paper proposed to detect an infant’s developmental reac- tions in reviews on picture books and showed ef- fectiveness of the proposed method through experi- mental evaluation. Future work includes developing a framework of recommending picture books which accepts the age of an infant and an expected develop- mental reaction as its input, and as its output, gives a list of picture books that are ranked according to
