 Word frequency effect in lexical decision task: evidence from Khalkha MongolianAbstractOne clue into the architecture of lexical memory comes from the presence of robust frequency effects in lexical decision tasks (LDT), in which subjects judge whether a written stimulus is a real word and processing complexity is measured by reaction time (RT).The recognition of words is facilitated (or inhibited) by its frequency as measured from the representative corpus. Our study verifies the word frequency effect in standard LDT performed by Khalkha Mongolian subjects. The results showed strong weight of word frequency as RTs predictor (R2 = .631, F (1, 28) = 50.57, p < .000, β = .802, t = 7.111, p < .000). Our experimental results also replicate Hino & Lupker (1998) findings on word frequency effects for Japanese Katakana (syllabic) and Kanji (logographic) words in standard LDT.IntroductionTumee OdonchimegKhovd State University Khovd, Mongolia odnoo_t@mail.ruVasha SainbayarKhovd State University Khovd, Mongolia v_sainbayar@yahoo.com   Frequency effects have long been known account for large amount of variance in lexical decision latencies (Howes & Solomon, 1951). Proponents of dual-route models (e.g., Baayen et al. 1997; Baayen & Schreuder, 1999; Caramazza et al., 1988) emphasize the role of whole word frequency in word recognition.Traditionally, the word frequency effect based on the findings that high-frequency words are responded faster than low-frequency ones inalmost any lexical processing task, including lexical decision, reading aloud, semantic categorization, and picture naming (Duyck et al., 2008). This effect is one of the most robust and well-known in word recognition research in different languages (Monsell et al. 1989; Allen, et al., 1995; Lien et al., 2012; Kwon et al., 2006). The lexical decision task (LDT) is widely used to reveal this effect. According to Gardner et.al. (1987) the difference in reaction times (RTs) is due to the differing frequency of high- and low- frequency words in the general language. This would imply that people making a lexical decision are influenced by their experience with the lexicon, and that greater experience leads to faster decisions. There is also another possible explanation of the word frequency effect. Landauer and Streeter (1973) showed that a number of lexical dimensions are correlated with word frequency. For instance, common and rare words have different distributions of phonemes and graphemes. A number of other differences exist as well. In Coltheart`s DRC model the effect of neighborhood size in LDT is proposed (Coltheart et al., 2001). N-value (the number of orthographic neighbors1) actually may be one of the robust independent variable in studying visual word recognition in LDT. Also bigram or sound clusters frequencies can significantly affect RTs. But these factors were not taking into account in our study because of the lack of any appropriate databases in Khalkha Mongolian.Another potential predictor of RTs is word length which can be based both on orthographic measures (number of letters) or phonological measures1 An orthographic neighbor is defined as a word of the same length that differs from the original string by only one letter.to 
 (number of phonemes and syllables). These different measures are generally highly intercorrelated, and they also correlate with other variables (such as the number of orthographic neighbors and the printed frequency) that influence word recognition.Recent visual word recognition studies (such as perceptual identification, lexical decision, naming, and eye movement recording) included word length as an independent variable (New et al., 2006). Experiments in English, Dutch, French and German yielded a mixture of null effects and inhibitory length effects. Investigating French word length and frequency effects, O’Regan and Jacobs (1992) found reliable inhibitory length effects in lexical decision and naming with words ranging from 4 to 11 letters. The effect size was around 15–19 msec per letter both in lexical decision and in naming. Furthermore, the authors showed that frequency and length did not interact. In eye movement study (Vitu et al., 1990) there was also no frequency and length interaction. In Balota, Cortese, Sergent-Marshall, Spieler, and Yap study (2004) the length effect was moderated by word frequency: it was significantly larger for low-frequency words than for high-frequency words. For university students, the length effect was even facilitatory when the analysis was limited to high frequency words and lexical decision. Another important result of Balota et al. (2004) was that their length effect was obtained after partialling out the length in phonemes, suggesting that the letter length effect is not a phoneme length effect in disguise. The results of other different studies tend to be inconsistent (New et al., 2006).Related worksLaCross`s study (2012) is one of the first research in Khalkha Mongolian speakers providing interesting findings on word frequency and vowel pattern frequency on RTs and familiarity ratings. The author`s results offer the first empirical support to the idea of separate lexical entries for non-adjacent phonological dependencies. Generally, word-familiarity task showed that Khalkha Mongolian subjects rated highest and responded fastest to high-frequency words with high frequency vowel patterns (such as, a_a, e_e, ɔ_ɔ, o_o, a_i, ʊ_a, ai_i, u_e, i_e, ii_i, ɔ_i, ee_e, ʊʊ_ʊ, ɔ_ɔɔ).But there was no significant effect ofword frequency on RTs to high vs. low frequency words. Additionally, no significant effect of vowel pattern frequency was found either on subjects` ratings or RTs. As LaCross revealed the vowel pattern frequency effect only in nonword ratings and RTs, we assumed that in real words recognition more frequent patterns of vowels (graphemes) might be less informative than less frequent ones as declares in (New & Grainger, 2011: 326). Thus, LaCross hypothesized that real word frequency effects obscured and confounded any possible effects of vowel pattern frequency. Also such findings could be explained by unrepresentative corpus size LaCross used in the study.Recent studies (Brysbaert et al., 2011) claim that word frequency measures should be based on a representative corpus, but the quality of word frequency measures should be ascertained by correlating them with behavioral word processing data.Thus, the best way to verify LaCross`s findings is to take into account the General Corpus of the Modern Mongolian Language and related databases to compute word frequency (Krylov, 2012).Experiment CorpusTo compute word frequency we used the General Corpus of Mongolian (Krylov, 2012). It is the first resource of such type in Mongolian and contains 966 texts of different genres (1155583 words length). The corpus is lemmatized and glossed (in the script of the Leipzig glossing rules). The morphological analyzer (working within the Starling environment) is on the experimental stage, 97% of text word forms (which correspond to 76% of the word forms which are inputs in the concordance of word forms) can be effectively analyzed. There are also frequency dictionaries of different types, presented on the Starling environment2.2 http://starling.rinet.ru/cgi- bin/query.cgi?root=mongqrs&morpho=0&basename=mongqrs \mwf02f1a&encoding=utf-eng ©Krylov    
 SubjectsThe LDT was performed by Khalkha Mongolian adult skilled readers (n 48, 21 males and 27 females).MaterialThe list of items consists of 30 real Khalkha Mongolian words (nouns) with length at 2...8 letters. In our study we restrict our analysis to lemmatized words to avoid morphological factor, since complex words frequency could be determined by its components (base, suffixes). Also 30 nonwords were used from the previous studies (Trofimova et al., 2011). The word frequency was computed with “Alphabetical frequency dictionary of Modern Mongolian lexemes with quantitative properties of their grammatical manifestations in corpus”3. The whole item list presented in Appendix 1.Predictors of RTsWhile a vast number of RT predictors have been proposed in the literature, here we choose predictors which either reflect well-known properties of speeded reading or measure possible frequency effects at different levels of lexical memory. They are word frequency, orthographic word length, number of syllables. It is assumed that word frequency represent the most important predictors of lexical decision latencies (Lignos and Gorman, 2012).ProcedureWe used the typical LDT experimental design. As dependent variables, we measured the RTs (in milliseconds) and error rates (in percentages). Stimuli presentation and data collection were controlled by an HP ProBook 470 G2 using Inquisit 4 Lab software for Windows (Millisecond SoftwareTM). The strings of letters were presented in the center of the screen and in lowercase type. Each trial consisted of a 50-ms blank and then the target (word or nonword). Words and nonwords were presented separately and randomly until the subject decided whether the string of characters was a real Mongolian word. The response keys (“Yes”/”No”) were located at the extreme left and3 http://starling.rinet.ru/cgi-bin/main.cgi?root=mongqrs ©Krylovright ends of the bottom row of the keyboard. A practice list preceded the test phase in order to familiarize the subjects with the task and to standardize the RTs.Results and DiscussionFirstly, we examined the relation between each of three predictors (word frequency, word length in characters and word length in syllables) and the standardized RTs (in correct responses only), expecting the increase of RTs to the words with lower frequency and greater length (inhibitory effect).As it is assumed that RT distribution generally doesn`t correspond to Gaussian distribution (McGill, 1963) we calculated a nonparametric coefficient of correlation (R for Spearman) for each pair of variables. It was not significant neither for word length in characters (rs= .228, n=30, p = .225), nor for word length in syllables (rs= .026, n=30, p = .890). But we revealed strong negative correlation for RTs and word frequency (rs= - .622, n=30, p < .0001).To verify this we computed the regression analysis in reciprocal-Х model: Y = a + b/X. The results showed strong weight of word frequency as RTs predictor (R2 = .631, F (1, 28) = 50.57, p < .0001, β = .802, t = 7.111, p < .0001).Figure 1: Results of regression analysis of RTs: inverse linearity between RTs and Word Frequency as a predictor.The findings correspond to traditional thesis of Balota & Chumbley that the lexical-selection process might be frequency sensitive precisely in standard LDT (Balota and Chumbley, 1984). Our   
 findings are also appropriate for dual-route modelssince it is assumed that the lexical route directly accesses word entries in the mental lexicon in a holistic fashion and is affected by word frequency (Coltheart et al., 2001).Such “heavy weight” of word frequency as RTs predictor could be also explained with the orthographic depth hypothesis: relatively shallow orthographies with high grapheme-to-phoneme and phoneme-to-grapheme correspondence (such as Mongolian) are more easily able to support a word recognition process that involves the language phonology. In contrast, deep orthographies encourage a reader to process printed words by referring to their morphology via printed word`s visual orthographic structure (Katz and Frost, 1992). For instance, in English (with its relatively deep orthography) printed word frequency, number of syllables, and number of orthographic neighbors all make independent contributions on lexical decision (New et al., 2006). Recent research in French (also with relatively deep orthography) revealed letter frequency effects (New & Grainger, 2011).Our experimental results also replicate Hino &Lupker findings on word frequency effects for Japanese Katakana (syllabic) and Kanji (logographic) words in standard LDT. Except the main effect of word frequency another effect of script type was obtained: RTs were faster for Katakana word as well as nonwords than for Kanji ones. Hino &Lupker emphasize that in standard LDT such effects are specific for lexical-selection process only while a decision-making process involves retrieving phonological, syntactic, semantic information. Thus, lexical decision process requires more analytic processing and needs to verify in different lexical tasks as presented in (Hino and Lupker, 1998).ConclusionOur experiment revealed a negative correlation between Khalkha Mongolian word frequency and RTs in standard LDT. The results replicated the word frequency effect on visual word recognition obtained in most of the previous studies in other languages. The substantial portion of the word frequency effect on RTs was due to quantity of their occurrences in corpus. This is close to LaCross`s findings in familiarity ratings task:Khalkha Mongolian speakers rated high frequency words as significantly more familiar than low frequency ones (LaCross, 2012). The main question needs to be answered in future studies: how differ a lexical-selection process and decision process in Khalkha Mongolian subjects performing LDT and Go/No-Go LDT?Psycholinguistic studies on this topic tend to be more accessible in Khalkha Mongolian due to the providing statistical usage-based information about the language, e.g. the General Corpus of the Modern Mongolian Language (Krylov, 2012) and Mongolian Corpus project (Loglo and Sarula, 2011). Creating the corpora and frequency databases in Mongolian with behavioral word processing data could facilitate special lexical projects, such as English Lexicon Project4, French Lexicon Project5, Chinese Lexicon Project (Sze et al., 2014). Also, subsequent behavioral and psychophysiological word processing studies in agglutinative languages could provide new evidence from word frequency × vowel harmony interaction.AcknowledgmentsThe research is supported by grant of the Russian Foundation for Humanities and Ministry of Education and Science of Mongolia (project No. 13-24-03002).ReferencesAllen Philip A., Wallace Benjamin, and Weber Timothy A. 1995.
