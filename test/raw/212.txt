 Corpus annotation with a linguistic analysis of the associations between event mentions and spatial expressionsAbstractRecognizing spatial information associated with events expressed in natural language text is essential for the proper interpretation of such events. However, the associations between events and spatial information found throughout the text have been much less studied than other types of spatial association as looked into in SpatialML and ISO-Space. In this paper, we present an annotation framework for the linguistic analysis of the associations between event mentions and spatial expressions in broadcast news articles. Based on the corpus annotation and analysis, we discuss which information should be included in the guidelines and what makes it difficult to achieve a high inter-annotator agreement. We also discuss possible improvements on the current corpus and annotation framework for insights into developing an automated system.1 IntroductionEvery event is situated within some real-world space and textual descriptions that refer to events in documents also convey such spatial information. Such information is important not only for the interpretation of single events but also for the understanding of the relations among them. Spatial information can be used for various applications such as information extraction, textual entailment, and question answering. For instance, if we want to answer the question “Where did traffic accidents happen most frequently in 2014?,” we would need a* Corresponding authormethod to access and collect spatial information associated with all traffic accidents from the relevant textual descriptions. However, such information is usually not provided explicitly in text since humans can intuitively understand from the context where each event occurs.In general, two factors make it difficult to automatically recognize the location of events in text. First, there are usually more event mentions in text than expressions containing information about the location of events. A system must thus choose the most appropriate spatial expression for a given event mention. Second, such expressions are not always syntactically close to event mentions, which may make it less obvious to recognize their semantic association. The following three sentences exemplify different levels of difficulties in determining whether particular event mentions and spatial expressions are associated, i.e., whether a spatial expression refers to the space where an event occurred.(1) A fire [broke out]EVENT at [a refrigerated warehouse]SPACE yesterday.(2) A North Korean fishing vessel intruded 10 miles across [the Northern Limit Line]SPACE and South Korea’s Navy [fired]EVENT 6 warning shots.(3) He searched all over [the room]SPACE for his [missing]EVENT ring.Sentence (1) shows that the event mention and the spatial expression are syntactically connected in a single clause, which can probably be identified in a straightforward manner with a conventional semantic role labeler. Sentence (2) shows that they exist in the same sentence but not in the same clause, and that there must be some inference in order to 
 find out that fired is likely to occur around the Northern Limit Line; for example, intruded and fired can occur in a similar place and the time interval between them may not be too long. Sentence (3) shows that, even though an event mention and a strong candidate for its spatial expression exist in the same sentence, their association may or may not hold depending on the context; there may be another place where the missing event actually happened. In this case, the system may have to search the text backwards to find out where missing or other relevant events are mentioned. Such information may, however, not have been stated at all in the available text.In this paper, we present a linguistic analysis of how event mentions and spatial expressions are associated in text with respect to a corpus annotation process. More specifically, we discuss the following four issues:• which information should be included in the guidelines in order to recognize spatial information about events in text,• what kind of difficulties and issues arise during the annotation process,• what trends are found in the corpus, and• which factors could be of help to achieve a high inter-annotator agreement and to build anautomated system.The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents previous work on analyzing properties of events in text. Section 3 shows the proposed annotation framework for creating a corpus. Section 4 gives an analysis of the corpus and disagreements between annotators. Section 5 discusses issues on improving the proposed annotation framework, with concluding remarks.2 Related WorkResearch on analyzing aspects of events or relations among them has dealt mainly with temporal aspects and temporal relations. Much effort has been made to establish a specification for describing temporal properties of events in text and to create the labeled data, especially through the TimeML annotation standard and the TimeBank corpus (Pustejovsky et al., 2003a; Pustejovsky et al., 2003b). The availabilityofthestandardandcorpushaspromoted furtherstudiesonextractingtemporalinformation associated with events from text (Lapata andLascarides, 2006; Mani et al., 2006; Yoshikawa et al., 2009; Mirza and Tonelli, 2014), including the TempEval challenges (Verhagen et al., 2009; Verhagen et al., 2010; UzZaman et al., 2013).In contrast, analyzing spatial properties of events has received less attention than temporal analysis, though in recent years a few studies attempt to tackle relevant problems. SpatialML (Mani et al., 2008) presents an annotation specification for describing expressions that refer to geographic regions in a way similar to TimeML, but it deals only with spatial relations between non-event entities that are explicitly expressed in a single sentence. In a similar line, Spatiotemporal Markup Language (STML, Pustejovsky and Moszkowicz, 2008) was designed to annotate both the temporal and spatial properties of entities. While it includes the specification for spatial entities associated with events, it focuses primarily on associating motion events with motion-specific arguments, and does not deal with other types of event and other non- argument spatial entities found throughout the text. ISO-Space (Pustejovsky et al., 2011a; Pustejovsky et al., 2011b) addresses the integration of SpatialML and STML to establish the annotation standard. It considers events as a type of spatial entity and allows them to participate in spatial relations. However, these events are annotated only when the spatial relationship is explicitly stated in a single sentence. In particular, it does not consider implicit associations between general events and their spatial entities that are found across the text.Another line of work would be spatial role labeling (Kordjamshidi et al., 2010), which addresses the task of identifying the location of objects and their spatial relations triggered by spatial indicators such as on, at, and in. However, it does not cover the location of general types of event, though a recent series of the SemEval challenges on this task (Kordjamshidi et al., 2012; Kolomiyets et al., 2013) discuss annotating motions.Blanco and Vempala (2015) propose a method to infer temporally-anchored spatial knowledge from semantic roles. Their goal is to determine whether a certain argument of the verb is located in one of the locative arguments found in the same sentence and to temporally anchor their spatial relationship with respect to the duration of the target event. For example, given the sentence “John was incarcerated at Shawshank prison” and its PropBank-style semantic role annotation, they
 attempt to find out that John has been located at Shawshank prison during event incarcerated, but neither before nor after that event. This work makes use of properties of events to infer spatial knowledge, but does not handle the spatial relationship between events and locations outside the sentence.Unlike the work mentioned above, work on analyzing event-centric spatial relations has not received much attention. The most relevant existing work would be the annotation and recognition of spatial containment relations between event mentions (Roberts et al., 2012; Roberts et al., 2013). They aim at inferring that the spatial boundary of a particular event contains that of another event. For instance, given the sentence “The bombing victim died immediately,” they infer that the bombing event is likely to spatially contain the died event. Their work is closely related to ours since it attempts to analyze the spatial aspects of events. However, it does not deal with directly linking event mentions to spatial expressions in a document although they utilize spatial expressions as one of the features for recognizing spatial relations between event mentions. Instead, they put more emphasis on what they call “implicit relation features”, suggesting that the spatial containment relations could be recognized based on event semantic properties without relying heavily on contextual clues; we can see, for example, from the example above that the bombing and died events have some degree of semantic correlation. Their task does not necessarily aim at the recognition of such spatial expressions for events.To the best of our knowledge, none of the previous studies address the associations between event mentions and spatial expressions found across the entire text.3 Annotation FrameworkIn this section, we introduce our framework for annotating spatial expressions for given event mentions. We first describe the data we used for annotation and then present the definition of event mentions and spatial expressions to be annotated in a given document, together with the guidelines for selecting and labeling spatial expressions for given event mentions. We then present the overall annotation process and the corpus statistics.3.1 DataWe chose to use texts in the broadcast news domain for our corpus as they contain various spatially bound events that happen in the real world as compared to texts in the newswire domain which usually include many editorials and opinions.We used the data from the OntoNotes project (Hovy et al., 2006) in order to access diverse layers of linguistic annotations during our annotation process, such as part-of-speech tags, parse trees, named entities, and coreferences. We selected 48 documents from the collection of CNN broadcast news in OntoNotes Release 5.0 and used them as our corpus. Table 1 shows the statistics of the selected document collection. The figures in the table suggest that the corpus contains a varying number of words and sentences across the documents.Measure       FigureTotal number of documents         48 Total number of sentences         416 Total number of words         7,810 Average number of words         18.8The corpus also includes documents from various topics such as social issues, accidents, politics, finance, sports, and international news. We annotated the associations between event mentions and spatial expressions on top of these documents.3.2 Annotation guidelinesEvent mentionsThere is no de facto standard definition of event mentions, and researchers usually adopt their own definition that fits into the goal of their work. One of the most widely used definitions would be the one in the TimeML schema. It regards an event mention as “a cover term for situations that happen or occur” (Pustejovsky et al., 2003a). A range of verbs that exhibit changes in the state of the world usually belong to this category. However, we do not restrict event mentions to a certain category of verbs. Instead, we regard almost all verbs as event mentions whether or not they refer to a situation that  per sentence(std. dev. 10.6) Average number of sentences         8.7per document(std. dev. 7.6) Average number of words         162.7 per document(std. dev. 153.6) Table 1: Statistics of the data in our corpus  
 actually happened or that can be clearly anchored in a timeline. This is because we assume that any situations referred to by verbs including actions and states can be situated within a particular scope of space in the real world where it happens or takes effect. One of the goals of this work is to see if it is possible to pick out expressions that refer to such space for an event mention arbitrarily chosen within a given document.We consider as event mentions all single word tokens labeled with part-of-speech tags that correspond to base verbs, inflicted verbs, gerunds, and participles in the Penn Treebank parse tree of the OntoNotes annotations. These tags include VB, VBD, VBG, VBN, VBP, and VBZ. When gerunds and participles were found, we excluded be-verbs and auxiliary verbs used with them and annotated only those gerunds and participles. We also excluded verbs in some patterns that act as auxiliary verbs such as be going to and have to. For example, given the sentence “It has not been undertaken but will have to be considered,” we annotated only undertaken and considered as event mentions to be associated with spatial expressions. Unlike TimeML, we did not consider noun phases as candidate event mentions since it is not clear which type of noun phrase can refer to spatially bound situations. Analyzing spatial aspects of noun phrases would be another interesting line of future work.Spatial expressionsA spatial expression is either a single word or a sequence of words that refer to a particular space in which the situation or the state referred to by a given event mention happens or takes effect. More specifically, spatial expression S is said to be associated with event mention E if S refers to the space that encloses the spatial bounds of the event referred to by E while it happens or takes effect.We did not restrict spatial expressions to certain semantic classes as in other studies, such as geographic and geopolitical places (Pustejovsky et al., 2011a; Roberts et al., 2012), locative arguments (Blanco and Vempala, 2015), and entities with spatial indicators (Kolomiyets et al., 2013). We instead asked our annotators to choose any word or phrase that they think provides some information about the spatial bounds of events even though they are not clearly grounded in physical and geographic space, such as meeting, parliament, clashes, scene,demonstration, interview, network television, and political life.The annotation of spatial expressions relies largely on annotators’ intuitive understanding of the text. In order to enable consistent annotation, we asked the annotators to stick to the following rules which are central to our annotation process, among others.Rule 1: A spatial expression is either a noun phrase or an adverbial phrase. Our pilot annotation suggests that noun or adverbial phrases are sufficient enough to represent the space associated with events in text. However, we acknowledge one exception to this: adjectival forms of place names and their demonymic equivalents such as Canadian, South American, and Northern Irish can be annotated separately as a spatial expression even though they exist within a longer noun phrase, as shown in the example below.(4) The [Yugoslav]SPACE Election Commission claims he did not [win]EVENT more than 50 % of the vote.The annotators can choose Yugoslav as a spatial expression for event win if they consider it to be spatially bound in Yugoslavia. We found that the broadcast news exhibits this pattern frequently; such adjectival and demonymic forms themselves suggest a particular place for events when its nominal forms are not mentioned at all.Rule 2: If the annotators choose a certain word to be included in a spatial expression for a given event mention, they must annotate the longest noun phrase or adverbial phrase that contains it as a head word. These phrases can contain any kind of modifier such as a relative clause and another nested adverbial phrase, as shown the example below.(5) Students at a middle school in Calaveras County, California, are [getting]EVENT an unwanted lesson in entomology.Here, if the annotators choose school as a head noun of a spatial expression for event getting, they must annotate “at a middle school in Calaveras County, California” as its spatial expression, which is the longest adverbial phrase containing school as a head noun, according to Rule 2. However, if they choose County as a head noun, they must annotate “in Calaveras County, California” as a spatial expression. Our intention behind this is to include as much information as possible in spatial
 expressions by annotating the longest span of expressions.Rule 3: If there is more than one expression that refers to the space enclosing the spatial bounds of a given event, the annotators choose the one that referstothenarrowestspace.Forexample,forevent getting in example (5), we choose “at a middle school in Calaveras County, California” as its spatial expression instead of “in Calaveras County, California” since the former refers to narrower space than the latter.The intuition is that narrow space conveys more information than broad space; knowing in example (5) that getting is associated with a middle school would be more informative than knowing that it is associated with Calaveras County because the former is less vague than the latter.Rule 4: If there is still more than one expression that is not distinguished by Rules 1-3 above, the annotators choose the one that is closest to the event mention. The distance here is measured by the number of sentences between the event mention and its candidate spatial expression. If two equally qualified candidate expressions are found before and after the event mention, respectively, at an equal distance, then the annotators choose the one that appears before the event mention. If two such expressions are found in the same sentence, the annotatorschoosetheonethatissyntacticallycloser to the event mention.Rule 5: For event mentions referring to a motion that creates a path, the annotators choose three distinct spatial expressions that refer to the beginning, intermediate, and end of the path, respectively, if they exist. When choosing a spatial expression for each of these components of the path, the annotators follow Rules 1-4 above. Such motion event mentions include arrive, leave, travel, and return. The following example shows that two motion event mentions appear in a single sentence.(6) Finally, U.S. Marines [arrived]E1 [at the hospital]S1 to [take]E2 him [to Kuwait and to a specialist burns unit]S2.Here, for event mention E1 (arrive), spatial expression S1 (at the hospital) can be chosen as the end of its path. For event mention E2 (take), spatial expressions S2 (to Kuwait and to a specialist burns unit) and S1 (at the hospital) can be chosen as the end and the beginning of the path, respectively. Note that associating E2 (take) and S1 (at thehospital) may require some inference; for instance, E2 may happen shortly after E1 happens.Possible world analysis: As in the case of example (6), we always interpret the spatial bounds of events under the possible worlds assumption; even though they had not occurred or their occurrence is not clear, we estimate their spatial boundary by assuming the situation where they had already occurred. In this way, we can infer that event E2 (take) in example (6) has occurred in the space referred to by s1 (at the hospital). This type of interpretation can be applied to other similar constructions such as negation, condition, opinion, supposition, and conjecture.Distinction between definite and plausible associations: Since the spatial information about events is highly implicit in text as discussed in Roberts et al. (2012), in most cases, it would not be possible to annotate spatial expressions with 100% confidence. Certain types of association may be more difficult to justify than others. For this reason, we introduce an additional label to distinguish between definite and plausible associations.We consider associations to be definite if they can be reasonably inferred with common knowledge of the real world. In contrast, if the association cannot be inferred in such a way but is still presumed to exist in certain circumstances, we consider them to be plausible. The following example shows a sentence that contains both types of association.(7) For the second day in a row, Lieutenant General Jay Garner was [mobbed]E1 by friendly crowds after [touring]E2 [a Kurdish school in the northern [Iraqi]S1 city of Irbil]S2.Here, the association between event mention E2 (touring) and spatial expression S2 (a Kurdish school in the northern Iraqi city of Irbil) is considered to be definite since they are syntactically connected. On the other hand, it would be difficult to be fully confident that event mention E1 (mobbed) can be associated with S2. This is probably due to the existence of temporal relation indicator after. It suggests that there might be some time interval between E2 and E1, leading the annotators to believe that their locations might be different. In this case, their association is considered to be plausible. If when is used instead of after in this example, the association could be considered definite. The annotators are allowed to choose only one spatial expression for each of the two types of association
 for a given event mention; in other words, for general event mentions, the annotators choose at most two spatial expressions: one for the definite association and the other for the plausible association.3.3 Annotation processThe process of annotating event mentions was fully automated because identifying them relies only on part-of-speech tags which are already provided by the OntoNotes annotations. Spatial expressions are annotated by our annotators, but only when at least one event mention is associated with it; in other words, we did not allow ‘dangling’ spatial expressions to be included in our corpus, as explained in the annotation guidelines. If the annotators fail to find a spatial expression for a given event mention, they just left it unassociated.Two annotators participated in the annotation process. They were first provided with the documents that have been pre-annotated with event mentions. They then went over each document and for each event mention chose the text span of spatial expressions that are best associated with the event mention based on the guidelines. After that, they put a labeled link between the event mention and the spatial expression. One of the six labels can be attached to a single link: three labels for the definite associations and three labels for the plausible associations. We also provided the annotators with the web-based annotation tool to facilitate this process. The annotators are also allowed to consult information in the OntoNotes annotation files if necessary for more informed decisions.Multi-phase annotation: In order to resolve disagreements and to improve the quality of the annotated data, we divided the entire annotation process into four phases and held a meeting whenever the annotation in each phase was completed. In each meeting, the annotators measured the inter-annotator agreement (IAA), analyzed and resolved disagreements, and revised the guidelines if necessary.4 Corpus Analysis 4.1 StatisticsTable 2 shows the statistics of the annotated data in each annotation phase. On average, 85% (721/846) of the event mentions are associated with at leastone spatial expression. This means that for most of the events it is possible to find descriptions of spatial information within a single document. Each spatial expression is associated with 2.5 (337/846) event mentions on average. Each document contains an average of 7.0 spatial expressions with a standard deviation of 5.4 and an average of 15.0 associations with a standard deviation of 14.5.Phase Total Statistics       12345 15 10 18      45 139 72 160          898 2694 1554 2664  95 319 160 272            31 121 69 11685 270 140 226          # documents 48 # sentences 416 # words 7810 # event mentions 846 #spatial          expressions 337 # associations 721  Table 2: Statistics of the annotated dataFigure 1.

Distribution of the distances between event mentions and spatial expressionsFigure 1 shows the distribution of phrase types of the annotated spatial expressions. The phrase types are obtained from corresponding phrase tags in the OntoNotes parse tree annotations. The figure suggests that adverbial phrases such as locative prepositional phrases take up only less than half the whole spatial expressions and that it is also important to consider noun phrases as candidate spatial expressions.Figure 2 shows the distribution of distances between event mentions and spatial expressions in the corpus. The distance here is the number of sentences between them. If the distance is zero, it means that they exist in the same sentence. The figure suggests that in many cases, spatial    23Noun phrases Adverbial phrasesAdjectives (place names) 7% 161 153 48% 45%         
 information about events can be found in local context; 61% (440/721) of them are found in the same sentence. The other associations, however, would require some degree of inference.4.2 Disagreement analysisInter-annotator agreement: Conventional IAA measures such as Cohen’s Kappa are not applicable to our task because we are not dealing with the data from a fixed set of categories; for each event mention, the annotators must choose the text span of spatial expressions from the entire text. In this work, we address IAAs by calculating the ratio of event mentions for which the two annotators agree. In order to make comparisons for different levels of strictness, we consider the following four cases of agreements for each event mention in documents.(a) SIMPLE MATCHING: The two annotators both agree or disagree that the given event mention is associated with some spatial expression.(b) SPAN OVERLAPPING: One of the spatial expressions annotated by one annotator overlaps one of the spatial expressions annotated by the other annotator. This corresponds to a loose measure for comparing two associations.(c) SPAN MATCHING: Each spatial expression annotated by one annotator exactly matches with one of the spatial expression annotated by the other annotator, and vice versa.(d) SPAN AND LABEL MATCHING: The text span and label of each spatial expression annotated by one annotator matches with those of one of the spatial expressions annotated by the other annotator, and vice versa. This corresponds to a strict measure for comparing two associations.al. (2012). The task requires the combination of contextual clues and the world knowledge, and relies heavily on the annotators’ intuition and interpretation of implicit information. The annotators sometimes have different interpretations of definite and plausible associations, though they reached an agreement in the discussion after each annotation phase. Near-perfect agreement would thus not be a practical goal in this task.Simple mistakes: Aside from the disagreements caused by the implicit nature of the task, the annotation within the current framework also produced a number of mismatches in choosing the exact span of spatial expressions even though the annotators correctly chose their head word. They also sometimes made a mistake in choosing the longest phrase by dropping modifiers. Another type of mistake is not to choose the closest one. This case happens when different expressions that refer to the same place are mentioned in a single document. The annotators often missed a closer expression and chose the distant one that refers to the same place, which are not actually genuine errors. We found that more than 40% of the disagreements in phases 3 and 4 are due to these types of mistake.Although it is difficult to clearly classify the type of disagreements other than the mistakes above, we found that there are some frequent cases of disagreements as shown below.Remote agents: In some cases, it is not clear whether the agent is remotely involved in a given event. This may cause disagreements between the annotators, as shown below(8) Kostunica says he won’t [turn]EVENT Milosevic over to a tribunal [in The Netherlands]SPACE where he was indicted as a war criminal.One of the annotators was confused whether event turn can be associated with spatial expression in The Netherlands. The discussion led them to agree that event turn does not necessarily imply its agent being located in the remote place if there is no further contextual information that supports it.Abstract events: It is often difficult to identify the spatial bounds of events because of their vague interpretation.(9) After today's air strikes, 13 Iraqi soldiers [abandoned]EVENT [their posts]SP ACE and [surrendered]EVENT to Kurdish fighters.       12340.79 0.78 0.80 0.86      0.58 0.63 0.49 0.63      0.48 0.53 0.39 0.44    0.48 0.49 0.36 0.42 MeasurePhase       Avg.SIMPLE MATCHING               0.81 SPAN OVERLAPPING               0.60 SPAN MATCHING               0.47 SPAN AND LABELMATCHINGTable 3: Inter-annotator agreements  0.44  Table 3 shows inter-annotator agreements for each phase and the entire corpus. Although the overall agreements are not very high, we believe that this is due to the highly implicit nature of spatial information in discourse as discussed in Roberts et
 Here, while it is clear that event abandoned and spatial expression their posts are associated, it might not be so clear whether surrendered and their posts can be associated with each other. One annotator considered surrendered as a kind of declaration and associated it with their posts, but the other annotator considered that surrendered involves the location change of its agents into the place where the entities to which they surrender are located, i.e., the location of Kurdish fighters. For this disagreement, the annotators agree that there is a plausible association between their posts and surrendered.Containment relations among spatial entities:Some documents contain several expressions that refer to geographic regions in spatial containment relations. For example, one of the documents in our corpus has seven candidate expressions that spatially contain one another, as shown in Figure 3. This made it difficult for the annotators to determine which must be chosen as a spatial expression for a given event mention, especially when its spatial boundary is not clear.improvements can be made on our current framework.One of them is to restrict event mentions and spatial expressions to a certain category of words in order to remove cases where their spatial boundaries are too implicit. For instance, we could annotate only the event mentions referring to the situation that can be temporally anchored as in TimeML, or could restrict spatial expressions to geographical entitiesasinSpatialMLandISO-Space.In order to avoid disagreements raised by mistakes in choosing an exact text span of spatial expressions, we may allow for annotating only head words and let the annotation tool automatically choose the longest phrases using the parse tree of the OntoNotes annotation because our goal is not to identify the exact boundary of such phrases.Another possible improvement is to augment the current annotation to incorporate further linguistic information in order to facilitate the annotation process and to enable more practical evaluation. The most important one would be to annotate the spatial containment and coreference relations among spatial expressions. As discussed in our disagreement analysis, the annotators often make mistakes or disagree when choosing among spatial expressions that refer to highly overlapping regions, as in Figure 3. It may not be practical to make a sharp distinction among them. The current IAA measures in our framework do not consider the possibility of ‘partial matches’: for example, “in the West Bank and Gaza” and “clashes in the West Bank and Gaza”. In order to assess the performance of an automated recognition system, there should also be a proper evaluation metric that compensates for these cases, such as CEAF in coreference resolution (Luo, 2005).Future work also includes increasing the size of the present corpus and augmenting it with other layers of linguistic information such as event coreference. We also plan to build an automated system to recognize the associations with various linguistically motivated features. Our corpus is publicly available at http://nlp.kaist.ac.kr/resources.AcknowledgementsThis work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korea government (MSIP) (No. NRF- 2014R1A2A1A11052310).  “Israel”“in the Middle east”“both sides” “Palestine”“in the West Bank and Gaza”“clashes inthe West Bank and Gaza”“West Bank” “Gaza”  Figure 3. Relative containment relations among seven spatial expressionsCascading disagreement: Disagreement that arises in a particular event mention often propagates through other neighboring mentions, especially when a set of related events that occur in a short time is mentioned in consecutive sentences. This is because the annotators usually try to cluster similar events first, and then associate them with a particular special expression at the same time.5 Discussion and Concluding RemarksIn this work, we proposed our framework for annotating associations between event mentions and spatial expressions to analyze spatial information about events in text. Although the highly implicit nature of spatial information makes it difficult to achieve consistent annotation, we see that further
