Graph Theoretic Features of the Adult Mental Lexicon Predict Language Production in Mandarin: Clustering CoefficientAbstractGraph theory has recently been used to explore the mathematical structure of the mental lexicon. In this study we tested the influence of graph measures on Man- darin speech production. Thirty-six na- tive Mandarin-speaking adults took part in a shadowing task containing 194 mon- osyllabic words, 94 of which consisted of 3 phonemes and were the items under analysis. Linear mixed effect modeling revealed that clustering coefficient (C) predicted spoken production of Mandarin monosyllabic words, while network de- gree, in this case its phonological neigh- borhood density (PND) failed to account for lexical processing. High C resulted in shorter reaction times, contrary to evi- dence in English. While these findings suggest that lexical processing is affect- ed by the network structure of the mental lexicon, they also suggest that language specific traits lead to differing behavior- al outcomes. While PND can be under- stood as the underlying lattice for which a similarity network is created, lexical selection is not affected by only a target word’s neighbors but instead the level of interconnectivity of words (C) within the network.du.hk1 IntroductionGraph theory is currently an active tool within the language sciences. Networks constructed from the semantic knowledge of children have shown typi- cal versus disordered development (Beckage et al., 2011) and helped to explain the growth of vocabu- lary (Hills et al., 2009). The network structure of phonological networks has been found to influence children’s productive vocabulary development and failed lexical retrieval in adults (Vitevitch et al., 2014). The new methodology coming to form in- volves the combination of graph theoretic models and psycholinguistic tasks, allowing for a view into the lexicon to examine language processing ac- cording to structural relations.The manner in which a phonological network is constructed is through what is known as phonolog- ical neighborhood density (PND), which is a simi- larity metric that involves the addition, deletion or substitution of a single phoneme (Vitevitch, 2008). Thus, in the network, words (nodes) are connected (edges) to one another based on their sound simi- larity. Words that are connected via this similarity are known as neighbors and give us the network feature known as degree (k). In the psycholinguis- tic literature PND has been extensively investigat- ed. It has been shown to influence word recognition (Luce and Pisoni, 1998), production (Sadat et al., 2014), and word learning (Storkel et al., 2006) to just name a few.Once the network is built, other measures are then available, such as each node’s clustering coef- 
ficient (C). C is the number of triangles made in relation to a given node. In terms of the mental lexicon, this presents us with a measure of how interconnected a word’s neighbors are with each other. It has been illustrated with an English lexi- con that PND and C are not equivalent measures in that they do not correlate with each other (Chan and Vitevitch, 2009). The role of C has been exam- ined in word recognition (Chan and Vitevitch, 2009; Yates, 2013), and picture naming (Chan and Vitevitch, 2010), allowing for the tentative state- ment that, at least for English speakers, low C words are produced faster and more accurately than high C words.While research into the network features of the mental lexicon has advanced rapidly, there has been an inordinate stress upon European lan- guages, specifically English. Mandarin, to date has no evidence of either a PND or C effect on lan- guage processing, despite several attempts (Myers and Tsay, 2005; Tsai, 2007). One reason for such a disparaging lack might lie in the complexity of the Mandarin mental lexicon, specifically the role that tone plays. Indeed, Vitevitch and Stamer (2006) propose that differences in processing found be- tween languages are likely to be found due to the linguistic differences exhibited by many languages.In comparison to English, Mandarin has a small syllable inventory (~400 without tone). This lan- guage specific feature might suggest a lexicon that would be more dense, leading to increased compe- tition between neighbors. Tone however creates distance between what would be otherwise similar sounding words. Tone, in fact has been shown to be the initial guiding point for phonological ma- nipulation (Neergaard & Huang, 2016; Weiner & Turnball, 2015).The purpose of the current study is to investi- gate the role of network characteristics in a tonal language through the implementation of an audito- ry shadowing task.2 Methods 2.1 Participantstions. None of the participants reported speech, hearing, or visual disorders.2.2 StimuliThe stimuli, recorded by a female native Mandarin speaker from the Beijing area, consisted of 193 Mandarin monosyllabic words. All stimuli were 415ms in duration. Target stimuli, which can be seen in Appendix A, consisted of 94 words that were 3 phonemes in length. Filler words consisted of 99 monosyllabic words that contained 1, 2 and 4 phonemes. Filler words were used in the task so as to preclude the participants’ ability to predict the structure of upcoming words. Presentation order nian2lian2qian2xian2mian2 qian1Figure 1.

was pseudo-randomized so as not to allow for the serial presentation of words that began with the same onset or that had the same tone.The stimulus words were selected from a data- base of movie subtitles (Subtlex-CH: Cai and Brysbaert, 2010). As is common amongst data- bases that provide calculations of PND and other lexical information (See Marian et al., 2012 for an in-depth discussion), a representative sample of orthographic words is chosen from either a dic- tionary or subtitle movie corpora. The current study calculated PND and four of the following word characteristics from the top 17 thousand en- tries of phonological words. The pinyin transcrip- tions of the Subltex-CH database were made using the Lingua Sinica corpus (Chen et al., 1996). Pho- nological representations of spoken Mandarin were then taken from Neergaard and Huang (2016) ac- cording to the maximal syllable structure: CVVX plus tone.The frequencies of homophonous words were summed together such that spoken word frequency (SWF) (M: 0.0271 per-million; SD: 0.0556 per- million), and homophone density (HD) could be calculated. HD (M: 5; SD: 4) was calculated based on the number of orthographic words that were used in the corpus per each phonological word. Neighborhood frequency (NF) (M: 18,1950; SD: 20,2318) was calculated from the combined fre- quency of a word’s neighbors. C (M: 0.4065; SD: 0.1623) was calculated through the use of the net- work analysis tool, Gephi (Bastian et al., 2009). It should be noted that the correlation between PND (M: 14; SD: 5) and C within our stimuli set was low: 0.3. For an illustration of the difference be- tween PND and C see Figures 1 and 2. Note that both represent words with equivalent densities.2.3 ProcedureParticipants were seated in a quiet room in front of a computer running experimental software, E- Prime 2.0 (Psychology Software Tools, 2012). They were instructed to repeat experimenter- provided auditory stimuli into a headset as quickly as possible. The onset of each trial was activated when a participant spoke via a PST Serial Re- sponse Box. They were given a practice set of 10 words.Each trial consisted of the same sequence: “下 个词” (next word) was presented at the center ofthe screen for 1000ms, followed by a blank screen and the onset of the target audio which changed either upon the onset of a participant’s spoken re- sponse or a maximum of 3000ms, then finally a pause of 3000ms. The entire experiment took less than 15 minutes and was recorded on a second computer using Audacity 2.0.6.Reaction times were measured offline using SayWhen (Jansen and Watter, 2008). The audio recordings were also used to transcribe the partici- pants’ spoken production by two native-Mandarin speaking volunteers. Incorrect responses were re- moved from the analysis, accounting for less than 6% of the data.3 ResultsStatistical analyses were done using linear mixed effect modeling (lmerTest in R). The first constructed model revealed that SWF (t = -2.462; p = 0.014) and C (t = -2.771; p = 0.0056) were predictors in the production of Mandarin monosyllabic words, while PND, NF, and HD were non-significant. In order to eliminate the effect of SWF on the other pre- dictors, 96 trials, identified as outliers, were removed from the total of 3,177 trials. The removal of the outliers, which accounted for 3% of the total, limited the responses’ reac- tion time to within 450 and 1000ms.Figure 3.

While the SWF effect disappeared, and none of the other predictors changed status, the ef- fect of C remained through each successive 0.735 0.73 0.725 0.72 0.715 0.71                                                                                                                                                                   -0.4 -0.2 00.2 0.4 0.6Clustering Coef7icientReaction Time
model iteration (Std. Error: 0.00820; df: 3037; t = -3.27; p = 0.001). Unique to this study, high C values resulted in shorter reac- tion times as can be seen in Figure 3.4 ConclusionThe present study is the first to find an influ- ence of network measures on language pro- duction in a tonal language. Of particular note is the fact that the direction of the C effect is contrary to that of the English findings (Chan and Vitevitch, 2009, 2010). While the two prior studies implemented different tasks to what is currently featured, the direction was the same for English speakers: words with low C were produced faster and more accu- rately than words with high C. The present results, in contrast, suggest that the greater the interconnectivity of phonological words the less the competition for lexical selection.One direction for further investigation is the role that network density plays across the Manda- rin lexicon, specifically during development. If, like the present findings suggest, greater connec- tivity speeds processing, then this would imply the emergence of an adaptive trait learned through the acquisition of highly similar words. Such a lan- guage specific adaptation would have impli- cations for vocabulary acquisition and possibly be of note for children with phono- logical delay (Gierut et al., 1999).An alternative hypothesis is that a signifi- cant C effect concurrent with a null PND ef- fect points to an error in the model’s construction. There have been multiple pro- posals as to the segmentation of the Mandarin syllable (Duanmu, 2009). In the current study we examined a segmental approach with pho- nological tone. Future experimental designs would benefit from contrasting stimuli that have been calculated according to multiple segmentation schemas.ReferencesDuncan J. Watts, and Steven H. Strogatz. 1998.
