 Language and culture: the language choice in multicultural Kazakhstan  mass deportation of repressed peoples in pre-war years to Kazakhstan; People migration, ethnic deportation and evacuation of the population during the war and postwar years, accelerated recruitment in the industry; the development of virgin and fallow lands, resulting in significant changes in qualitative and quantitative composition of the population, e.g., the Russian population in those years grew by 21% (from 1,279,979 to 3,974,229  people.), while the share of Kazakh decreased by 24.7% (from 3,713,394 to 2794966 people.), which led to a decrease in the number of Kazakh to 30.0% and an increase in the share of Russian population from 19.9% to 42.6%; massive migration outflow in 1970-1979., which led to the fact that the negative balance of migration of Kazakh exceeded in the 1979-1989. 2.2 times, and Russian - 1.9 times; a return of the Russian-Slavic and German populations to their historic homeland in years of sovereignty. finally, the geopolitical changes that accompanied the transition from the USSR to the CIS have changed the concept of statehood, including the assessment of the role of ethno-national element in public life and public-political structure and a pronounced desire for revival of ethnic languages and cultures (Suleimenova et al., 2003).In modern Kazakhstan there are Kazakh and Russian languages actively used, which had a great influence on the formation of a new culture, which is due to historical background, the interaction of ethnic groups living in Kazakhstan. This process has led to the synthesis of cultures (Kazakh, Russian, Kyrgyz, Uighur, Korean and others cultures).A modern resident of Kazakhstan is actively using Russian and Kazakh (national) languages and a foreign language less frequently. However, if knowledge of languages cannot be called perfect, the people of modern Kazakhstan have information about the cultural traditions of different ethnic groups living in Kazakhstan. This is especially evident in the knowledge and application of national cuisine dishes of different ethnic groups. So, beshbarmak (Kazakh national dish of horse meat and dough) and Russian pancakes, dumplings and Ukrainian Peking duck) can coexist on the table a Kazakhstani person.Kazakh and Russian languages are used by one million people, that therefore belong to the number of vehicles to 4% of the world's languages and the leaders in the number of their speakers in the country. In addition, there is large number of bilingual citizen with second AbstractModern Kazakhstan is - a multicultural, multilingual and multi-religious country. According to the latest population census of the Republic of Kazakhstan, the indigenous ethnic groups is – Kazakhs (66.01%), accounts for the majority of the population. Further largest ethnic groups inhabiting the country are - Russians (21.05%), Uzbeks (3.07%), Ukrainians (1.7%), Uighurs (1.44%), Tatars (1.17%) and others (Statistics Agency of Kazakhstan, 2014). Such ethnic make up of the country naturally affected the linguistic situation in Kazakhstan. As it is known, the Law on languages in the Kazakh SSR (adopted September 22, 1989) introduced the concept of a "National Language" where Kazakh language was given the status of the state language, and the Russian language has been designated the de-jure status as the "language of interethnic communication." Later amendments to the Constitution of the Republic of Kazakhstan dated August 30, 1995 stated that Russian language will be equal to the state “language”.The current language situation in Kazakhstan has a long history. First of all, I would like to clarify the definition of the term "language situation". Socio-linguistical Dictionary offers the following definition: "Language situation - the real context of language use in society, a set of language/languages, forms of existence of language, territorial and social dialects, Koine, jargons, operating in the administrative-territorial associations (ethnic community) in a certain historical period (Suleimenova et al., 2008).IntroductionThe formation of the ethno-linguistic situation of Kazakhstan was influenced by processes and events in the country in different periods of its existence. This accession of Kazakhstan to Russia (1731-1865); repeated revision of the state borders; especially state-political system of pre- Soviet, Soviet and post-Soviet periods and events of recent years, which had extraordinary consequences for all the people of the country; radical transformation of the entire social system, society and economy modernisation of independent Kazakhstan. Importantly, according to several scientists (E.D. Suleimenova, J.S. Smagulova, O.B. Altynbekova and etc.)the following factors played a major role in the shaping a current situation: withdrawal of 30% of the total land area, during the Stolypin agrarian reform an eviction of Kazakhs and resettlement of peasants from various provinces of Russia and Ukraine, resulting in a formation of a large Slavic ethnic groups in the north-west, north, east and south-east of Kazakhstan; demographic disaster of 1929-1933., which reduced population of the republic by 2.4 times and in no small measure contributed to the transformation of Kazakh in to minority in their historic land until 1966;
 Kazakh or second Russian language, which also increases the factor cofunctioning both languages.In this gard, for scientists studying the social and cultural features of the language, it is important to study such questions as:- In what spheres of social life languages are used?- What is the relationship between the Kazakh and Russian languages by status and functions?- Which language is dominant?- What is the role of home and family languages?- How, under what conditions and in what forms ofbi- and multilingualism arises?- What language choice is determined in any givensituation?To try to answer these questions, we conducted anexperiment to analyze the "language timing".The experiment, referred to as “language timingday” was proposed and initiated by Professor of University of Helsinki Dr. E.J. Protasova. We know that experiments to study the language timing day were carried out by professors A.Yu. Mustajoki and Rozhdestvenkii.Language - is an element of culture. In the conventional sense – it is a collection of words, organized according to certain rules, which makes up its grammar. According to the English scientist R.T. Bell, a language - is set of transmitted through the culture of behaviors common to the greatest culture of individuals, i.e. society (Bell, 1980).From the perspective of social science language is a set of behaviors and symbols. It is a social construct, which appeared at the dawn of human history. By the language we fix symbols, norms and customs. In the language we share information and scientific knowledge (Avrorin, 1975).At the turn of the century the language as a social phenomenon has been the subject of a number of studies in philology and non philology, i.e. those disciplines that today referred to as the border, but, interdisciplinary, cultural studies, and these are cultural linguistics, ethnography and ethno linguistics, sociology and sociolinguistics. Given that the language is not only a part of the culture, but also means the preservation, development, continuity of cultural, civilizational social systems, the research in linguistic processes are essential for the further development of society as a whole.A special place in the study of the social aspects of language development takes sociolinguistics, which originated at the junction of two sciences - sociology and linguistics. The attention paid to socio-linguists, not only in their own language and its internal structure, but also on how people use language, make up a particular society. This takes into account all the factors that may affect the use of the language by themselves speaking different characteristics (age, sex, level of education and culture, kind of profession, etc.) to the specific characteristics of the speech act.When sociolinguistic approach to the language the object of study is the functioning of the language; its internal structure is adopted as a kind of reality and is not subject to special scrutiny. In societies where there are two, three languages, several languages, sociolinguist should investigate the mechanisms of functioning of multiple languages in their interaction.What is meant by timing the language of the day? The word "timing" (literally. From English. Timing timing) today in communication is used quite widely. As you know, the word originates from the technical and economic sphere, where it is understood as the most opportune moment to buy or sell shares on the stock exchange (Raizberg et al., 2003). Timing is the work schedule, is the next step after the administration of the project brief (sh.- brief). Once the agency to define the tasks, the project is included in the step of forming the optimal solutions and the timing of milestones. Timing signed with his client and agency side.In the communication space of the CIS countries, the term was actively used recently and is used today is not much in the technical field and the exchange, and how in the field of psychology, sociology, sports and etc. For example, quite often you can find the word 'timing' in conjunction with the word 'day' i.e. "Timing of the day" and refers to the scheme of the day, daily routine. It is noteworthy that our internet search on this phrase in Russian (approximately 222 million items) have the largest number of responses to the word 'wedding' e.g. - ('timing of the wedding', 'the timing of the wedding day', 'the perfect timing of the wedding day'). It is fair to note that there were also options of 'birthday timing', effective timing of the day, in particular, the terms associated with sports and sports industry (timing fitness and so on.).Thus, the term 'timing of the day' – is a measurement of the amount of time spent on various types of communication in a certain period. In linguistic science the use of time, the opportunity and effort to learn the language and/or languages.In the proposed task informants were suggested to observe in what language to whom, how long does the communion take place in one day. This study involved 36 respondents, who live in different cities of Kazakhstan, study or work, the average age between 22 - 43 years old. All the informants have higher education degrees, with nationalities such as - Kazakh (28), Russian (5), other ethnic groups (3). In this article we offer to look at some of the responses which were received from the informants to show a part of the whole information.For example: person A. wrote about language timing of her working day *:- From 9:00 to 17:00 I'm at work, I speak mainly on 60% Russian.- I conduct correspondence and communicate with foreign students 20% daily in English,- Kazakh language is used on demand – up to 20%of maximum.-Communication at home - 50% of Russian and50% in Kazakh, unfortunately.- I cannot tell you exactly how I use languageshour by hour, but in general, it turns out as I wrote as above.(* authors grammar and punctuation are preserved).This informants nationality – is Kazakh. She has varying degrees of Kazakh, Russian and English languages ability, considers herself as a polilingual, working in the
 field, where used all the languages (Kazakh, Russian, English). From her words, the dominant language at the work – is Russian language (60%). The rest is the English language - 20% (daily) for communication with foreign students; Kazakh language is used rarely(if necessary) – 20%.The degree of language use of the people who live on the territory of Kazakhstan is largely dependent on the policy pursued by the state. This work plays an important role in cultural project "Trinity of languages".In October 2006, at the XII session of the Assembly of People of Kazakhstan President noted that the knowledge of at least three languages is important for the future of our children. In 2007, message to the Kazakh nationals "New Kazakhstan in the new world," the Head of State proposed to begin a phased implementation of the cultural project "Trinity of languages". From that moment, counting the new language policy of independent Kazakhstan has begun,which today can be an example for other countries in the degree of popularity in the community and level of efficiency in this time. Harmoniously entered into a process of spiritual development of the people, the language policy is inseparable from the common policy of large-scale social modernization. The President believes the success of the modernization is very important that each citizen of nation must be useful to the Fatherland. Modernization is necessary for all Kazakhstani people. Only with understanding all of this psrts can be achieved by a wide public consensus and success (Nazarbayev, 2007)."Kazakhstan should be perceived worldwide as a highly educated country - has repeatedly stressed the President – which citizens speak three languages. They are: Kazakh language – is the state language, the Russian language – is the language of interethnic communication, and English – is the language of successful integration into the global economy" (Nazarbayev, 2012). For Kazak, the idea of trinity languages is especially important, because the Head of state was formulated in response to the challenge of the time as a vital needs of society, actively integrating into the global world. The integration of Kazakhstan into the world community today depends on the awareness and implementation of a simple truth: the world is open to anyone who can acquire new knowledge taken by the mastery of dominating languages. Due to the initiative of the President our country started to implement the concept of Multilinguism in education, because it will strengthen the competitiveness of Kazakhstan.A modern linguistic situation in Kazakhstan suggests trinity of languages as a significant factor in the strengthening of public consent. The diversity of cultures and languages and their equal co-existence is an absolutely treasure of our country and the language policy pursued by both ensure compliance with the language rights of all ethnic groups, and provides a free choice of language of communication, education, implementation of creative needs. The positive development of multilingual for the Kazakhstan community is possible while a single political, ideological and cultural platform. And this platform is already defined by the President to clarify the essence of the "Trinity of languages" - the study of Kazakh as the state language, Russian - as the language of international communication and English - as the language of successful integration into the global economy.Creating a level playing field for the study of three designated languages does not mean an equal to the scope of their operation, an equal to a functional load, and finally their an equal status. The emphasis placed on educational component of this cultural project, which can be fully designated as multilingual education. However, the intensification of the controversy surrounding the language situation in Kazakhstan in the last several years is associated with multilinguism that allows us to speak about the new faces of language education. In this connection, in the answer of the informant, it can be traced ownership of three languages and use them in a single day. Languages and using them at work, during working hours and in the family.Since the family in the modern state is the most popular social institution, the greatest interest for the study is the analysis of language in the family. The informant is the bilingual, which uses two languages - Kazakh (50%) and Russian (50%) languages. As of today, the Kazakh family is a bilingual society, there are two demographically powerful languages in the country - Kazakh and Russian. It is noteworthy that according to the informant, they regret that the Kazakh and Russian languages are mixed and used equally and simultaneously.Another example that the informant is using the three languages every day:Hello) 8:30 - 17:30. During this period - 20% of correspondence and conversations pass in English (for a work necessary).At home - 90% Russian. Kazakh did not really use in everyday life.In this example, we can mention of the pronounced role of the Russian language. Since informant use it is in family communication. Russian language can be either the first language of communication, the second. During business hours, the informant uses the English (20%) is due to the need of professional activity. The informants family uses the 90% of Russian. Another noted that the Kazakh language really does not even use, it turns out that in this case there is no need to, in the family communication. Finally, on the use of the Kazakh language falls to its lowest level -apparently, due to the fact that the scope of communication is becoming more professionally oriented. Because in the field of specific information - professional, social, political, cultural, anyone beyond the scope of family kitchen -Russian language dominant (zakon.kz). It should be noted that the Russian language in Kazakhstan according to the Constitution of the Republic of Kazakhstan officially used on a level with the Kazakh language in state organizations and local authorities (Constitution of the RK, 2005). This fact affects to the speech behavior of all segments of society, in particular the authorities of the Republic of Kazakhstan, dominated as prestigious Kazakh and Russian languages (his position in society, properties, and fields of use language). The prestige of the language (from the French. Prestige <lat. praestigium cheating) English. The language prestige - a comparative evaluation of individual, group, society, the
 social significance of the language (Suleimenova et al., 2008).Russian language in the republic, according to the Constitution of the Republic of Kazakhstan "officially used on the level with the Kazakh." It retains all the functional scope: used as a means of accumulation and acquisition of information, ideological influence, the means and the object of education, an integral part of the spiritual culture of the Kazakh society. It is not coincidence that the Russian language as a language of international communication, is included in the cultural project "Trinity of languages", together with the state of the Kazakh language and English - the language of successful integration into the global economy. This is due to a key requirement in maintaining the Russian language, with historically established in Kazakhstan integration features, as well as the fact that he is a carrier of a significant amount of scientific and cultural information (Sabitova).Modern linguistics, is distinguished by its anthropocentric character, gives priority to the study of human speaking, in a constant process of communication (verbal / non-verbal, virtual and so on.). Introducing person speaking linguists differentiate basic components - language, speech, communication. So, V.V. Krasnyh highlights the following components: talking human - the person, one of the activities of which is speech activity; actual language personality - personality, manifesting itself in speech activity, which has a collection of knowledge and understanding; voice personality - a personality that realizes itself in communication, select and implement a particular strategy and tactics of communication, the repertoire of tools; communicative personality - individual participant a specific communicative act, actually acting in real communication.At the same time, considering the linguistic identity should distinguish between social and individual, manifested through language skills and attitudes to language. It should be noted that the observed processes of globalization inevitably influenced Homo Loquencs. Today it is difficult to find the identity of monolingual, especially among the youth and younger generation. It is noteworthy that for the residents of the former Soviet Union the problem of bilingualism manifested primarily in the Russian-national bilingualism, today the political transformation, economic and social conditions, the establishment of the state of ethnic identity and the CIS countries have enabled citizens of the Republic, along with linguistic renaissance of the national language in addition to Russian language to revive the national languages, to learn other languages.For Kazakhstan, multilingual and polynationalcountry the problem of bilingualism - it is a historical phenomenon. Like any post-Soviet state, Kazakhstan has experienced significant transformations of political, ideological, cultural content. It is fact that the observed linguistic and cultural diversity of the country affected by a number of historical factors, in particular, as the E.D. Suleimenova is a process accompanied by the accession of Kazakhstan to Russia (1731-1865); repeated revision of the state borders; especially state-political system of pre- Soviet, Soviet and post-Soviet periods and events of recent years, which had extraordinary consequences for all the peoples of the country; radical transformation of the entire social system, the modernization of society and the economy of independent Kazakhstan.For the recognition of the Russian language in Kazakhstan the national option to be considered, in addition to the mass and the length of its interaction with the Kazakh language and culture, and the effect of other factors: the specific sociolinguistic characteristics of its carriers, the isolation of language, originality of communication conditions, the presence of deviations from the standards and norms, codification and etc."The Russian language, having an international world and regional international status continues to be the language of mutual understanding and cooperation between peoples, is the best means of consolidating the integration and the CIS countries, despite the fact that changes in the political and social sphere led to a change in Russian-language communicative space the world and in Kazakhstan" (The language policy of the RK, 1999). However, these processes have not led to a change in the linguistic status of the Russian language in Kazakhstan, especially the emergence of some special, new version of the Russian language in the CIS today.We can say that the using the Kazakh and Russian languages varies depending on the field of communication. As the complexity of it Kazakh language displace by the Russian language. Thus, the Kazakh in the family communicate mostly in their native language. In the friends group growing use of Russian - due to the fact that in this circle includes people who do not speak Kazakh, partly because of the expanding range of topics for communication. Finally, using the Kazakh falls to its lowest level - apparently, due to the fact that the scope of communication is becoming more professionally oriented. Because in the field of specific information - professional, social, political, cultural, anyone (Constitution of the RK, 2005) goes beyond the scope of family kitchen -Russian language dominates.Another example is the fact that the language situation is bilingual.2) 7: 00 At home: Russian + Kazakh;8: 30 - taxi: kazakh + Russian;9: 00-19: 00 At Office the Russian - 60%, theEnglish 35%, the Kazakh-5%;19: 00-21: 00 if at home: Kazakh-50%, Russian50%, if outside - Kazakh-20%, Russian 80%At the present stage of development of Kazakhstanthe sociolinguistic science actual description of the functioning of languages as part of the language policy of the state in the context of the language situation observed. Language policy as an integral part of the state policy in the theory of sociolinguistics is defined as the deliberate and science-based management of the operation of existing languages and the creation of new and improvement of language means of communication, as well as the theory and practice of conscious and deliberate action of certain subjects of language planning functions and course of development of the language (Suleimenova et al., 2009).The development of the language situation strategically defined language policy of the country, carried out by adjusting the language construction. The observed changes in the language policy of Kazakhstan led
 to changes in the use and functioning of languages - Kazakh, Russian and other languages of ethnic groups living in the country. Polilinguality of language situation in Kazakhstan due to the operation of dominating the Kazakh and Russian languages, which led to the phenomenon of bilingualism in the country. Based on the fact that the processes of bilingualism respond to national factors of language development, the observed dynamics of the language situation in Kazakhstan is reflected in the speech behavior of the majority of social groups, especially youth.In the analysis of verbal behavior of certain social groups made use of the methods and techniques, has firmly established itself in sociolinguistics. Methods of sociolinguistics are interdisciplinary in nature, because with their help, investigates the social and linguistic phenomena in their relationship.In a study of linguistic characteristics and preferences of participants of communication widely use methods of collecting material (observation, interviews, surveys, questionnaires, etc.). Scientists widely used method of interview (G. Bonham, V. Meyer-Shenberger, T. Oberlehner), based on the immediate and direct social and psychological interaction between the interviewer and the respondent, in accordance with the goal and objectives of the study. The advantage of this method is due to the fact that the investigator receives the material to be analyzed in the course of natural communication with the communicant, not from a prepared text, on which the author has had enough time to think. Respondents depending on the purpose of the experiment can act as an expert, i.e., experts in a particular field of activity.For the active research methods in bilingual communication is the method of questioning. The survey - one of the main types of the written survey, carried out when dealing with the respondent using questionnaire. As the researchers note in the course of the survey is mandatory for filling out passport control which is part of the questionnaire (social and language passport respondents), since the processing and analysis of the questionnaire responses are carried out in correlation with this part of the questionnaire.To distinguish the following types of survey: group, individual, post. In our opinion, the analysis of bilingual communication survey is the most appropriate method of analysis. Here, an important factor in the study variables such as the choice of language, the prestige of the language and so forth. To obtain reliable answers is the principle of anonymity.In the selection of linguistic facts, collected with the help of these methods the study formed a data bank - organized set of results of linguistic research. New technologies today will be used to analyze a variety of communications software programs, which occupies a special place to use SPSS - program of statistical information, which allows the researcher to obtain opportunities for processing of the empirical data of linguistic research. The basis of the program SPSS is the base module that provides a variety of data access and data management.It contains the analysis of methods that most frequently used. Traditionally, along with the basic module, used modules, advanced models and regression model. The researcher is able to use the entry procedure, the selection and data correction. Along with simple methods of statistical analysis (frequency analysis, calculation of statistical characteristics, contingency tables, correlation, graphing) described module includes tests and sophisticated methods (linear regression analysis, factor analysis, cluster analysis, analysis of variance, analysis of the suitability (reliability analysis) and multidimensional scaling).This article presents some results of a sociolinguistic study of verbal behavior bilingual Kazakh youth, namely, language preferences, languages change and language prestige, foreign language and other inclusions.The study was conducted with using the methods of interviews and questionnaires. In this regard, it was important to take into account all stages of the assay procedure. Researchers in the field of communication theory used (Boris Streltsov, V.A. Tishchenko and etc.) The traditional scheme of the interview, which includes the following steps:1. The initial stage. Interviewer agree in advance of the meeting with the respondent in this case, a politician, or a representative of his team;2. Deploy dialog. It is important for the interviewer to develop the ability to listen and hear his collocutor. To prepare the next stages of the master must be able to control the rhythm of the conversation, to support the so- called "spirit of cooperation";3. Control of the reliability of information during the interview. Since the main purpose of the interview is to obtain information from certain people the facts, the course of the interview is unacceptable distortion of information, inaccuracies, so the permissible specification, repeated questions.4. Monitoring of the respondent during the interview (the appearance of the interlocutor, the use of non-verbal communication by the respondent and so on.);5. Commit (recording, storing, use of technical means of fixing the conversation);6. Check the details after the interview. For the purposes of the validity of the information used by the respondent to the comparison of the statements reliable source of information, other respondents.Anexample, how to use in daily life several languages:In the whole day I use three languages: Russian, Kazakh and English.In the afternoon attheuniversity or library, I mostly communicate in Russian.In the evening, with my roommate I talk in theKazakh language,because shedid not understand Russian). Since Ilivein a dorm, my neighborswhen theysaw me,theybegin to communicate with me in English, so theypractice their English with me.This respondent in thedaily life mainly uses Russianlanguage. But nevertheless in the response allows elementary errors. This may indicate that the respondent is colloquially competently uses the Russian language, but in the letter it is reflected differently in the form of grammatical errors (po russkii). Itissaid that not everyone is bilingualpersonboasts that he knows two languages on
 an equal level and that is not always the letter, and at the same time we areliterate. Therole of the state language is not always dominated by the respondents in everyday life and that there is a tendency to the formation of the Kazakh- Russian and Russian-Kazakh bilingualism.An official language performs the most important function of thestate and public life. According to the Constitution (Article 7) (Constitution of the RK, 2005) in the Republic of Kazakhstan is a state language is Kazakh language, on a levelwith Kazakh in state organizations and local authorities officially used Russian language.It is fact that the demand oflanguage usedepends on the degree of motivation in recent years andin the country is increasing of English as a prestigious, helped by active learning in school,usingin public life, as well as due to the economic and financial interests of people, especially young people. It is necessary to answer that the population of Kazakhstan are mostly bilingual, the younger generation of Kazakhs became clear emerging trend towards the formation of the Kazakh-Russian and Russian- Kazakh bilingualism, whereby all areas of language usage observed the process of selecting a preferred thelanguage useas one of the languages disadvantage bilingualism in certain verbal communication.An example of how two languages share using simultaneously.1. In the morning, when I wake up,we are greeting with my husband in Russian language,with children - in Kazakh. Why? Because I want to be a natural with myhusband. (Even it is difficult tore-educateand I want to teach children to greet / say goodbye / talk polite words in Kazakh.2.withsisters - on Russian language,this is more comfortable.3.with father- in Kazakh language,because he does not like when we talk inRussian language.4withmother – mixed languages.5.withmother in law - is also mixed, because they do not care.6.withneighbors - in Kazakh, because it is perceived as a Russian "vypendrezhka"7.witheldest daughter communication on Russian,(she goes to the Russian school) on everyday topics in Kazakh. I wantthat she will becompetent in both languages.8.withconductors - in Kazakhlanguage.9.with doctors- moreinRussian language.10.in themarket - in Kazakhlanguage. 11.withthedaughter'steacher –in Russian,because sheworks in Russiaschool and she doesn'tno Kazakh language.Thisansweris a good example of how two languages are used at the same time in our country. What is required to prove in this article. According to this information, we can determine what is spoken by the informant, Kazakh and Russian languages.Interesting the fact why the informant greets in the morning with her husband in Russian language andinKazakh with children? However, it feels natural?With the mother-in-law mixed the languages? And why are they all the same?Hereweneed togive a definition to the term,howinformant throughout the day actively selectedthe language to communicate with different people, Language choice 9 Suleimenova et al., 2008). 1. The preferred use one of the language/bilingualism language variants at a certain speech situation, depending on the field of communication, especially the context of social structure and scope of the language use. 2. The preferential of a particular language usein a particular speech situation incode-switching. 3. The preferred language use of some form of existence of in diglossia. Language choice of social significance.The communicationwith the neighbors inKazakh language, because Russian is perceived as "vypendrezhka"(“show off”). There maybemajor factor that the region in which the respondent lives. Because in some regions of our country the Russian language is perceived negatively. People react negatively when they hear anotherlanguage. These are regions where the dominant language is Kazakh and when someone uses another language, it looks in decently.Because they just do not need Russian. Population – Kazakhs people. The information field is formed by 90% with the participation of the Kazakh language.Communication with conductors in Kazakh language. Why? Because mostly on ourpublic transport in different citizenour country there are working Kazakh people with Kazakh language. Rarely you can meet people of Slavic origin. But here we can not tosay that they speak only Kazakh language. Basically, all the stops are announced in Russian language, as strange as it may sound.Conclusion.The analysis shows that the most prestigious language use in population are Kazakh and Russian languages., which is a guarantee of their functional and communicative power.Besides that the fact of the status of the Kazakh language enshrines in basic legislative acts of the Republic, to linguistics no less important in this respect are variables such as the functioning of language, language choice and language prestige. In our opinion, the main component of the social status of a person acts prestige of the language, understood in sociolinguistics as a comparative evaluation of individual, group, society, the social significance of language, his position in society, properties, fields language use [2]. Today the problem of language prestige is most relevant for modern Kazakhstan in sociological perspective problems, psycholinguistics and political communication. Interest in this issue is due to the dynamics of the development of modern language situation, particularly noticeable in such polylingual countries like Kazakhstan.
