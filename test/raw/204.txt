KONGISH (HK ENGLISH) - CASE OF SOCIAL ACCEPTANCE AS A NEW VARIETY Page 1 of 11Abstract     World Englishes have been defined by different scholars. The models do not agree with each other. Kachru, one of the most common scholars, has the Three Circles of English defining different varieties.Hong Kong English, with its history and social background, does not fit in its categories. Setter, author of Hong Kong English argues that it is not an independent language.Recently, in Hong Kong, there has been a controversial yet ludicrous event widely report in the media. Thus emerged a facebook page rewriting the news in the form of a parody by using what it claims Kongish.Kongish has many features and its rules are rather arbitrary. However, the parody was widely accepted and shared. People wrote comments on the language used positively. A lot of people replied in the same style of English – Kongish.Therefore, I argue that Hong Kong English has become a variety. I will also discuss its features and make a discourse analysis on the text and discuss its social and educational implications.   IntroductionWhen I was about 11, I laughed, when my friend called me ‘die eight woman’. I understood instantly what she said. She was cursing me. I took it as a sense of humor and laughed it off. Never did I ever use the same language.In school, The Chinese accent of my teachers repulsed me, with their level of English in question (Morrison and Liu 2000), I had little interest learning English from school. Instead, I focused on learning English from movies because it was native and sounded so cool. Consequently, my grades in English were never exciting because I did not know how to read or write well.My personal story brought out mainly two issues: prestige and social acceptance of native Englishes and social identity and English language education associated with the non-native varieties.Unaware of the historical background, globalization of English and the post-war cultural dominance of American media (Schneider p52 2011), this model of English featured in movies I was madly in love with was actually one of the native varieties called American English. As to which category the pre-colonial English taught in school belongs to, Setter (2010) argues that it is
KONGISH (HK ENGLISH) - CASE OF SOCIAL ACCEPTANCE AS A NEW VARIETY Page 2 of 11 problematic to place Hong Kong English into the paradigm based on Kachru’s Three Circles of Englishtheory.Here is Kachru’s Three Circles of English, one of the most common one to define World Englishes.Kachru’s Three Circles of EnglishThe layers of the circle represent the three varieties that he postulates.The inner most circle refers to the native varieties – Australian, American, British and so on, while the outer circle refers to areas where English is used as a lingua franca and in official functions, such as in politics, education, legal system. Examples are Indian English, Malaysian English and Nigerian English.As to the expanding circle, English used in these countries is localized and have features influenced by their native languages. English is not necessarily the official language. The majority of the people in these countries may not all possess a level of English like those in the outer circle and the inner circle.Kachru claims that the native varieties in the inner circle provide norms for the people in the outer circle to follow, whereas the expanding circle depends on the inner circle’s standards.His argument is problematic as to where Hong Kong English stands. First of all, within the inner circle, there are already different norms such as American English and British English defined by Streven’s World Map of English. The definition of the expanding circle is norm-dependent, which means it cannot develop its own characteristics. (Sandra Mollin: English as a Lingua Franca: A New Variety in the New Expanding Circle?). As learners, the speakers in the Expanding Circle are not given the right to their own variety-development, but are seen as norm-dependent. Hong Kong English has very clearly its own characteristics.There is another relatively newer model by Schneider defining the different Englishes.Schneider’s Dynamic Model of classifying World Englishes.Schneider (2007) coined a new term to unite all varieties of English. ‘Postcolonial Englishes’. Given that English originates from the UK, and United States was a colony, all Englishes except British English are under this model.Schneider (2011)’s new approach to categorize World Englishes:He argues that“...Postcolonial Englishes...builds upon earlier developmental schemes and argues that emerging varieties of English in postcolonial contexts have typically followed an underlying, fundamentally uniform evolutionary process caused by the social dynamics ...involved in a colonization process”
KONGISH (HK ENGLISH) - CASE OF SOCIAL ACCEPTANCE AS A NEW VARIETY Page 3 of 11He believes that in the long run, with group identity formation and acceptance, social separation will decrease. The new dialects will be more accepted as different varieties. Prestige of native varieties will eventually disappear.In this paper, I intend to prove that Schneider’s postulate can be applied to Hong Kong English. Hong Kong English is now widely accepted thanks to a parody of a recent news report posted on a facebook page called Kongish Daily.Kongish DailyA Hong Kong man spent HK$400,000 on his marriage proposal to his girlfriend. The whole process was filmed and the couple was interviewed. An original version as well as the parody written in Kongish are in the appendix.The incident became the talk of the down due to its exorbitant and unique nature. A teacher of English teaching at the tertiary level started a public facebook page called Kongish Daily on 3 August 2015. His first post was about the extravagant proposal written in Kongish with a humorous and sarcastic twist. Within a day, it drew 10,000 likers.It was then reported on Apple Daily, Headline Daily, Coconuts Hong Kong, Hong Kong Free Press, Next Magazine about the funny style and overwhelming acceptance.Most, if not all of the readers gave positive comment on the language used – Kongish. Most of the them were written in Kongish too. Fewer people actually commented on the ludicrous nature of the proposal. As of 12 August, the post drew 12,673 likes, 5,061 shares and 2,370 comments whereas the page has gained 27,000 followers.The style of the writing will be discussed in the next section. First of all, it is important to understand that discourse.Discourse AnalysisBrown and Yule (1993) explains that language has two functions – one is to give information (‘transactional’), and the other is to express social relations and personal attitudes (‘interactional’).The original news report, as seen in Appendix I, is already somewhat interactional. An attitude is already expressed in the first two paragraphs“It had all the makings of a Hollywood action thriller: a six-figure budget, a dramatic helicopter ride, sky-high action from the tallest skyscraper in Hong Kong and a 10-minute window to make the deal of a lifetime.But this mission impossible was no blockbuster movie, but a Hong Kong man spending close to HK$400,000 to propose to his girlfriend.” (SCMP, 4 August 2015)First of all, it presupposes that a Hollywood action thriller has a six-figure (in HK Dollars) budget. Whether all the readers agree with this remains the question. However, it is clear that the second paragraph exhibits an attitude. Implicature, defined by Grice (1975) as an implication, suggestion or meaning distinctive from what the speaker’s literal expression is applied. Mission impossible in the first sentence in the second paragraph connotes an
KONGISH (HK ENGLISH) - CASE OF SOCIAL ACCEPTANCE AS A NEW VARIETY Page 4 of 11 opinion. In this case, ‘mission’ is an implicature, with the marriage proposal being thereferent.In the parody version, Grice’s (1975) Cooperative Principle was evidently observed based on the news report in ‘funny language’ as well as the replies which constitute conversations in a way.Grice’s (1975) Cooperative PrincipleGrice’s (1975) Cooperative Principle has four maxims. He theorizes that the maxims: quantity, quality, relation and manner are normally obeyed in conversations.In the case of this event,• QuantityThe information is not just a repetition of the formal news written in Kongish. The tone is rather subjective, with the reporter on Kongish Daily posing as a man having personal feelings about the event. The personal accounts are sarcastic and funny. Even with the writer’s perspective included, the text is rather short, keeping the most important information (about how the money was spent) with some information from the original report omitted.The focus was on the extravagance and the writer’s feelings.The length is just right and not too long to bore readers.• QualityPerhaps what inspired the writer of Kongish Daily to write this news in Kongish is his own amusement and sense of humor judging the event. From the overwhelming likes and shares, it is evident that not only the readers agree with the writer, they are also amused. Its wide and unprecedented acceptance came out as a surprise even for the writer.• RelationRelated to the high-profiled current event. Social phenomena such as social problems. How some people are materialistic and how the writer finds the proposal unreasonable. Language used is highly related. Readers build a common ground with the author.• MannerThe writing is straight to the point – sarcastically depicting a lavish proposal by an ordinary man to an ordinary woman. The text is concise well-organized.The conclusion to the application of four maxims are followed impeccably and the delivery of information took place wonderfully. It also cultivated a stronger sense of cultural and linguistic identity.Let us look at the language used in the text.Hong Kong EnglishFor a long time, according to Bolton (2002), in Hong Kong, English with local features phonetically and lexically does not seem to be accepted by the society. Education policies highly favor Englishes in the inner circle (Kachru, ---; Bolton 2002). English used in business and
KONGISH (HK ENGLISH) - CASE OF SOCIAL ACCEPTANCE AS A NEW VARIETY Page 5 of 11governmental institutions employs the exonormative model. Hence, Hong Kong style English has always been looked down upon. For public examinations, students with a weaker level and write English with features of Cantonese are in an unfavorable situation for university entrance and jobs.This point to debate of whether Hong Kong English is considered a true variety and it is embraced by Hong Kong people? Yes to the latter question, but what about the status of Hong Kong English?Bell (1976:147-57) used seven criteria to determine if Hong Kong English exists. The following are the criteria:• Standardization (process of codification)• Vitality (existence of a living community of speakers)• Historicity (a sense of belonging through the language)• Autonomy (language perceived by its speakers as different from other languages)• Reduction(its varieties not seen as independent languages)• Mixture (purity of a language felt by its speakers)• De facto norms (what is good or bad in this language)According to Bell, Hong Kong English only somewhat fulfils the requirement of vitality.Chinglish, with a negative connotation, refers to English sentences with features of Chinese syntax and lexical items directly translated from Chinese. (Bolton 2002 pg 59)When Hong Kong English was written in 2010, Schneider (2007) suggests that“With the recent return of Hong Kong to China...the development of Hong Kong English will be an interesting test case for the Dynamic Model, but ...the drive to use English is stronger than might have been anticipated.”Pang (2003:15) also forecasts that “a change is seeping in with technological applications” He explains that English and Chinese code-switching is prevalent in email and ICQ interactions. At the time email was still widely used for personal communication. Today, there is no longer ICQ but Whatsapp, facebook, facetime, Wechat and all other channels of instant messaging and social networking. He is correct that it has led to the indigenization of English in Hong Kong – our Kongish.Bell’s approach to differentiate languages is applied below. Some comments from the facebook page as well as my translation and arguments are shown below.Historicity (sense of belonging)The following sentences exhibit a sense of belonging to a Hong Kong identity• Fiona Ho I ging like your writing, like going back to sec school days, siu L sei “I love your writing style so much, it’s like going back to secondary school days.”• Maggie Cheung Add oil a Kongish daily! Nei bring jor ho dor laughter bei ngo dei!! “Way to go Kongish Daily, you brought a lot of laughter to us” 
KONGISH (HK ENGLISH) - CASE OF SOCIAL ACCEPTANCE AS A NEW VARIETY Page 6 of 11 Autonomy (different from other languages – Cantonese!)• Holly Luk Love your kongish reports, finally a page for Non Cantonese readers !• Hoiyat Siu To call this language "kong style english" doesn't do justice to its richnessand colour and depth and utter brilliance.• The wide reports by different media on its prominence, popularity and comprehensibility.De facto norm (good/bad speakers)This criterion is not defined because the style can range from people to people.Mixture (purity of a language felt by its speaker)• Marjorie Law ...I can show you my whatsapp chat portfolio you no need train me I can write like this zi dung bor gar la!Reduction (not seen as independent languages)• Yen Yip A Konglish news a day, keep the bullshit 9up news away!! Support hard• Helen Ling wish kongish daily steam steam day up!!• People write differently, some with more English words, some with more CantoneseRomanized, but they are all categorized as one style. The readers do not distinguish them as separate dialects.Vitality (existence of a living community)• Bonita Wong lum hei ngo dei hai gchat king gai use d kongish Thinking about how we gchat so much using Kongish• The overwhelming likes and sharing on facebookDiscourse analysisBrown and Yule (1983) postulate that there are two functions of language. One is to convey information, widely referred to as transactional and when personal feelings and viewpoints are expressed, it is described as interactional.In Tannen (2013), Herring explains that at the beginning, when the world wide map was launched in 1990, the early websites were mostly transactional with documents, list of questions and ecommerce sites. Then in the late 1990s, the web started to become interactional, with blogs, news online where readers could leave comments.It is hence not traditional written or spoken discourse but a mixture of two (reference – internet? Facebook discourse) due to the interactive style with comments freely by readers (selection of readers based on settings) and the edit function because it is an online version and hence the text can be edited, pinned...etc. This differs vastly with printed materials. (on online written materials for discourse)        
KONGISH (HK ENGLISH) - CASE OF SOCIAL ACCEPTANCE AS A NEW VARIETY Page 7 of 11Not only the speaker controls the production of communication, he/she (‘he’ from now on) need to pay attention to the interaction, for instance, the replies to the message and decide what should be done next, if there should be a reply to clarify.Features of Hong Kong English in that articleThe features are arbitrary. There are normally some English words and some Cantonese words translated into English, or a phonetic transcription of Cantonese all mixed together.A few points to note is that Cantonese has six tones and without indicating the tone, one needs to guess the character contextually. Even if the tone is indicated, there are homonyms. Hence, the high intelligibility of the text is remarkable. Another point to note is the transcription of the Cantonese words in the report is arbitrary. There is a systematic to Romanize Cantonese words. The scheme, developed in 1993 by the Linguistic Society of Hong Kong, Jyutping marks tones with numbers, much like the accent marks in Putonghua. However, the scheme has not been popularized.The following is an analysis of the syntax, morphology, code-mixing in the discourse1. Pure transcription from CantoneseExamples: dai la la (an exorbitant amount of), mea yeah (what matter), ho chi ho (seemingly)2. Hong Kong spelling of English wordsdunno (don’t know), bcoz (in native Englishes: cos/coz, abbreviation for because),3. CodeCountries such as India, Singapore, and parts of West, South, and East Africa are examples of Former British colonies where English has had a long history of naturalization, nativization, and indigenization that has resulted in the existence of regional varieties of the language which some scholars also now call New Englishes. (Tupas 2015)English as a lingua francaFor cross communication, the need to have a neutral variety, one that does not advantage one group over another is evident. Quirk (1985) proposes to promote a single, standard ‘international English’ based on native speaker norms on the grounds that he singularity would ensure ubiquitous intelligibility.The problem emerged is the native varieties of English are indeed not the most easily understood. (Smith and Nelson, 2006, p. 441). Given that there are more non-native speakers than native speakers, there is a need to have an English comprehensible to all parties including native as well as non-native speakers.What should be taught?Kirkpatrick (2007) proposes two options. One is to teach a widely accepted, prestigious and codified native variety such as US or British English, but the drawback is how well students can learn these rather complex varieties and resources for teaching.
KONGISH (HK ENGLISH) - CASE OF SOCIAL ACCEPTANCE AS A NEW VARIETY Page 8 of 11The other one is to teach a local model. This may be suitable for Englishes in the outer circle because they are well-established and quite well understood when it is an acrolect, a variety not dramatically different from the native ones as opposed to a mesolect (a version between acrolect and basolect) or basilect a very localized version. (Seargent 2012)ConclusionThe goal of this paper is NOT to advocate Kongish to replace an English variety that is appropriate for global communication. As to what this variety should be and how it should be taught, it remains the question.The main joyful conclusion is, finally, we have our own English – Kongish may it be a basolect but with a proven population, destigmatization, cultural and social acceptance as well as keen usage in daily life.Ho yeh! (Good thing)
KONGISH (HK ENGLISH) - CASE OF SOCIAL ACCEPTANCE AS A NEW VARIETY Page 9 of 11Appendix IThe original news report of the HK$400,000 marriage proposal from SCMP (2 August 2015)     Meet the Hong Kong man who spent HK$400,000 to pop the big question, and she said ... ?PUBLISHED : Sunday, 02 August, 2015, 5:05am UPDATED : Tuesday, 04 August, 2015, 2:42pmIt had all the makings of a Hollywood action thriller: a six-figure budget, a dramatic helicopter ride, sky-high action from the tallest skyscraper in Hong Kong and a 10-minute window to make the deal of a lifetime.But this mission impossible was no blockbuster movie, but a Hong Kong man spending close to HK$400,000 to propose to his girlfriend."I'm so surprised, I didn't expect that it would happen today because before, I always chased him to propose but he just said 'maybe November or December" so this was totally beyond my expectations," a teary Stephanie Cheung, 30, said yesterday, just minutes after saying yes to the big question.For Victor Tang, 37, it was the perfect end to months of secretly planning the elaborate proposal to Cheung, who also works for Hutchison Global Communications.First, he went shopping for a 1.5-carat diamond engagement ring that cost more than HK$200,000. Then he booked the couple into a HK$26,000 corner suite at the Ritz-Carlton more than 100 floors up in the ICC in West Kowloon, with sweeping views of Victoria Harbour.This was followed by the HK$150,000 helicopter flight, which went past the hotel room at precisely the right time pulling a massive banner - 15 metres tall and 30 metres long, or the size of a basketball court - with the words: "I love you! Stephanie BB, will you marry me?"And to top it all off, he spent another HK$15,000 for a video crew to capture the event."She doesn't like typical proposals," Tang said of his girlfriend of just over one year, so he ruled out the idea of going down on one knee in a fancy restaurant."She's shy so she wanted something more private but something dramatic, exciting, not traditional."Yesterday afternoon, after months of planning, the helicopter flying the red banner, which weighed almost 100kg, took off from Lantau.The round trip takes about 50 minutes so Tang's one-hour booking left him with just 10 minutes to make sure Stephanie was looking out over Victoria Harbour as the helicopter flew past."Some people will say it's crazy to do this, but she didn't ask for a big house or a high-class car and she doesn't always buy shoes or dresses or asks to go to fancy restaurants," Tang said. "But she wanted a memorable wedding proposal."I never imagined I would do something like this. I'm not a rich guy but I control my budget."Gavin Neale, whose company HeliAds arranged the event, said as far as he knew, Tang's proposal by helicopter was a world first. Many people had used a plane to pop the question, which worked out much cheaper but was not possible in Hong Kong due to air safety rules.

Eventually, I think about boat, eh the cargo, and the helicopter. And finally, I choose the helicopter with the big banner"You know, we always say, pay bill real "hon zi" (man). Victor gor pay jor totally HKD 400,000 for the bill. Actually, he pay jor d mei yea? here show you the list.1) 1.5 ct. ge diamond ring --> more than HK$200,000.2) A 5** hotel (Ritz-Carlton) more than 100/F ge hotel room --> HK$26,0003) One helicopter with a big banner (15m * 30m) "I love you! Stephanie BB, will you marry me?" --> HK$150,0004) A video team to video how he spend all the money --> HK$15,000Dai la la HKD 400,000, ho chi a dream for many poor guy. Normally, according to the Hong Kong income median, kong guy earn about 13000 - 14000 per month (Unless you are rubbish bin kong wah earn 13000-14000 PER DAY). Even ng eat ng play, a Kong guy yiu spend 30 month sin yau almost HKD 400,000. Just think think how impossible for most Kong guy, how many Kong girl will wait a Kong guy 30 months?But, if you really a rich guy and want to ask marry specially, you can still think think what Victor gor say about boat and cargo (ng ho ask me how to ask marry in a cargo. I assume it is not just ask marry in a big big metal box ((ng hai megabox okay??)) you see in kwai chung cargo harbour!)I dunno marry hai ng hai love graveyard, but i know if I spend HKD400000 just for ask marry, I must be hungry and die in the next many years!Victor gor, I am just a poor guy, so you win!   ReferencesBrown, G and Yule, G.
