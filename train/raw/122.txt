 1A Corpus-based Comparatively Study on the Semantic Features and Syntactic patterns of Yòu/Hái in Mandarin ChineseAbstractThis study points out that Yòu (have their own prominent semantic features and syntactic patterns compared with each other. The differences reflect in the combination with verbs1. Hái ( ) has absolute superiority inPengyuan Liu*National Language Resources Monitoring &Research Center, Beijing Language and Culture University liupengyuan@pku.edu.cnitems of Hái ( ), about three kinds of semantic items and two kinds of moods of Yòu ( ), such as[accumulation], [successive], and strengthen the negative mood, etc. Both of the two adverbs can be used to represent repetitive actions, the difference is that Hái ( ) expresses imperfective actions and Yòu ( ) expresses perfective actions. There has been abundant literature in studying the semantic features in linguistic field. To name a few, Hái ( ) indicates [continuous] and Zài ( ) expresses [repetition] (Jiang Qi and Jin Lixin, 1997). Ma Zhen (1999) differentiated the repetition semantic betweenYòu( ),Zài( )andHái( ),MaZhen (2001) described the usage of Yòu ( ) from a semantic background view, and she emphasized that it is essential to explain clearly the semantic background of every lexical or syntactic item that is taught. Gao (2002) studied the basic meaning of Hái ( ) from a cognitive perspective. Zhang Yis (2004) regarded Yòu ( ) and Hái ( ) as time adverbs. According to Chen (1993), Yòu ( ) emphasizes the [connection] from a perspective of discourse analysis, Hái ( ) emphasizes different points in a sentence. Other scholars such as Chu (1983), Shi Xirao (1996), Shen (2001), Shi Jinsheng (2005), etc. Some researches above has indicated that adverbs Yòu ( ), Hái ( ) are easy to confuse under certain circumstances. Lots of scholars also summarized and compared their semantic features and syntactic behaviors, including their similarities and differences. But most of the studies applied introspective methods,collocation with V+Bu (express [durative]. Yòu (collocations with V+Le (verbs. Yòu ( )+V+Le ([repetition], and Yòu (tends to express [repetition, derogatory]. We also find that the two words represent different semantic features when they match with grammatical aspect markers Le ( ), Zhe ( ) and Guo ( ). Different distributions have a close relation with their semantic features. This study is based on the investigation of the large-scale corpus and data statistics, applying methods of corpus linguistics, computational linguistics and semantic background model, etc. We also described and explained the language facts.IntroductionThe adverbs Yòu ( ) and Hái ( ) in Mandarin Chinese have a couple of meanings and usages respectively. For example, Lv Shuxiang (1983) Eight hundred words in Modern Chinese pointed out four kinds of moods and 13 kinds of semantic1 Including verb grammatical structures in a general sense. * Contact Author.) and Hái ( ))+V, which tends to ) has advantages in )+V and derogatory )+V tends to express )+derogatory verbs ✝✞✞✝✞✝✝ ✞✟✝✝✟✄  ✞✞✝ ✞✁✞☎✄✁ ✞✝  ✄ ✂✆
 which is subjective to a certain extent. Thus, some important issues have not arrived at any agreement yet.These two adverbs can be used to represent complicated semantics, in which some semantics have a close contact. We think it is necessary to find out the prominent characteristic of each word, and then we can make comparative analysis effectively. This study applies the method of corpus linguistics and computational linguistics, combines with the comparison methods of function words and semantic background model, to verify with syntactic behaviors. Based on the statistics of a large number of language facts, we draw some conclusions which are supported by the data, and we also analyze the specific facts. Firstly, from calculating the collocation frequency with verbs, we get their own prominent semantic and syntactic features of each word. According to the analyses of the data, we found that: 1) Hái ( ) tends to express [durative] and has superiority in collocation with V+Bu( )+V . 2) Yòu ( ) has obvious advantages in collocating with V+Le ( )+V and derogatory verbs. Pattern Yòu ( )+V+Le ( )+V means [repetition], Yòu ( ) + derogatory verb means [repetition, derogatory]. In addition, the paper also studied the collocations with grammatical aspect markers Le ( ), Zhe ( ) andGuo( ).Yòu( )ismoreeasytocollocate with Le ( ), Hái ( ) has obvious advantages in matching Zhe ( ) and Guo ( ). Different collocations show different semantic features. The study also shows that it is the semantic features of the adverbs that cause the different choices of collocation with the aspect markers. This study is beneficial to the study of aspect functions of time adverbs and language learning to a certain extent. Corpus resources: BCC2 and DCC3. BCC is a large-scale comprehensive corpus, which contains microblog, science and technology, literature, the press, 15 billion words in total. DCC only contains newspaper corpora. Being the important part of written language, DCC will not make grammatical2 BCC (http://bcc.blcu.edu.cn/) was developed by Institute of Big Data and Educational Technology, Beijing Language and Culture University.3 DCC (http://dcc.blcu.edu.cn/) was developed by National Language Resources Monitoring & Research Center, Beijing Language and Culture University.mistakes. We selected 15 newspaper corpora, 8 billion words in total.2 2.1Collocations with Verbs and Semantic FeaturesCollocation DataFrom observing the corpus, it is found that these two adverbs can occur with different syntactic patterns. Hái ( ) tends to modify “vbv”, such as “Ni Hai Ji Bu Ji De wo” ( ) [Do you still remember me], Zuo Bu Zuo Zhen () [be in clinic or not], Kao Bu Kao Shi () [take an exam or not]. Yòu ( ) tends to modify “vlv” and derogatory verbs, such as Ta Yòu Deng Le Deng ( ) [He waited a while again], Yòu Qiao Le Qiao ( ) [somebodyknocked again], Ta You Tong Lou Zi ( ) [He got into trouble again].Table 1 below shows the frequency distributionsand proportional distribution of Hái () and Yòu() in corpus. vbv vlv derogatory v freq freq freqHái Yòu total131 31 1346 5 203 4445 136 234 5791Table 1: The corpus distribution of Hái and Yòu   120.00% 100.00% 80.00% 60.00% 40.00% 20.00% 0.00%96.30%Hái( )77%vbv vlvderogatory v86.80%Yòu ( )              13.20%23%    3.70%       Figure 1: Proportional Distributions✓✒ ✑ ✂ ✍✕✔✂  ✂✁✏✄✏✂✎✄ ✎ ✍✂✌☞ ✁☞ ☛✡ ✁✡✠✟✞✁✞ ✝ ☎✄ ✆☎  ✄✂✄✂ ✄✂✆

Both of the patterns Hái ( )+vlv and Hái ( )+derogatory verbs 100% indicate [additional].Yòu ( )+vbv 100% expresses [additional], but only 5% of Yòu +vlv expresses [additional], 95% of Yòu ( )+vlv represents [repetition]. Yòu ( )+derogatory verbs 100% represents [repetition, derogatory].Tong Xiaoe (2002) pointed out eight kinds of semantic items of Hái ( ). The 2nd item is that Hái ( ) can be used to represent that something stays or keeps the same and original state. One of the syntactic patterns is Hái ( )+vbv.In this study we sum up this kind of semantic feature of Hái ( ) as [durative]. In table 2, [durative] is the prominent semantic feature of Hái ( ) compared with Yòu ( ).As we all know, in modern Chinese, Le ( ) particle indicates that the completed action occurred in the past. In this type of sentence construction, and Le ( ) can be marked for the perfective aspect according to previous studies. For instance, Wo Kan Le Kan ( ) [I just saw it for a while], Tui Le Tui ( ) [gave a push]. Both of the two examples are completed actions in the past.In table 5, the prominent semantic feature of Yòu ( ) is completely different from Hái ( ). Yòu ( ) has its own prominent meaning--[repetition], and expresses a derogatory sense when modifying a derogatory verb. The sentence including Yòu ( ) expresses something that is not looking forward to syntactic patternsfreq syntactic freq patterns/d /v /d /v /d /v /d /v /d /v389 /d /v 273366 /d /v 287 /d235 /d230 /d258 /v 231 /v 152 /v 130 syntactic patternsfreq syntactic freq patterns/d /d /d /d /d74 /d 7 26 /d 6 20 /d 4 14 /d 3 11 /d 1Table 4: Hái/Yòu+vlvBy analyzing the collocation and the data, we found that the two words present a very different distribution. As shown above, Hái ( ) collocates frequently with “vbv”. There are two kind of forms assume superiority in collocation with Yòu ( ) , one form is “vlv”, another is the derogatory verbs. We also found that the different syntax patterns carry different semantic features.Table 5 below are the corresponding semantic features distributions of Hái ( ) and Yòu ( ).

 according to Chu (1983:58), so from pattern Yòu ( )+derogatory verbs, we find the reason for Chu’s study.2.2 Description and ExplanationSo far, we have verified the different semantic features and syntactic patterns between Hái ( ) and Yòu ( ) by way of the data analyses and the corpus. Below are adequate descriptions. All the examples the study collected blow are from BCC. In order to save space, we won’t indicate the corpus source.[durative]:Hái( )+V+Bu( )+V(1) BuZhiDaoNiHaiJiBuJiDeWo()[ I don't know if you stillremember me.](2) JiaRuXiaYu,WoMenHaiQuBuQuShiChang? ( ) [Supposing it rains, will we still go to the market?]Hái ( ) above means “still”, “as before” in English. “Ji Bu Ji De” ( ) means “Shi Fou Ji De” ( )[remember or not]. As for Tong Xiaoe (2002) , the syntactic pattern Hái ( ) +v + bu( ) + vp implies a former item. In sentence (1), [Ni Hai Ji Bu Ji De ( )] implies the former semantic background--{Ni Yi Qian Ji De Wo ( ) [You remembered me before]}.[additional]:Hái( )+V+Le( )+V(3) DiSanTian,WoHeBaBaGaoBie,BaBa Shuo Le Xie Gu Li Wo De Hua , Hai Pai Le Pai Wo De Jian Bang, Jiu Wang Che ZhanZou Qu Le.

Before “Hai Pai Le Pai Wo De Jian Bang ( ) [and patted my shoulder]” Ba Ba Shuo Le Xie Gu Li Wo De Hua () [My father encouraged me]. In sentence (4), “Li Wei Dong De Zheng Le ZhengLi Mao, Hai Mo Le Mo Jia Hu Zi () [Li Wei Dong tidied his hat ,and check false beard]” express that “besides tiding his hat, Li Wei Dong also checking his false beard”.[additional] : Hái ( ) + Derogatory Verbs(5) Ta De Tong Nian Bu Jin Jing Li Guo Che Huo, Ta Suo Zai Jia Xian Hai Zao Yu Di Zheng.()[In his childhood, he lived through an automobile accident, otherwise,his hometown encountered earthquake.]In sentence (5), “Zao Yu ( ) [encounter]” is a derogatory verb, which expresses derogatory sense.

() [got into trouble again], You Zhe Guai Guai ( ) [don’t blame us again] mean “Zai Yi Ci ( )[once again]”. Eg (7) is used for the past tense. Eg (8) is a negative sentence with Bie ( ) [don’t], which is not a completed action.[additional]: Yòu( )+V+Bu( )+V(9) Hai Zi De Tong Nian Zhi You Yi Ci, Ni YaoHai Zi De Hui Yi Li Zuo Shen Mo Meng, You Neng Bu Neng Bao Zheng Ta Men Jiang         ❨✂❪❭✑☛❬✌✧✤✤ ✏✦✥✤✤✣ ☛✢✜✛❞▲✁▲☛✡✠✘✗✟◆❱❯❚✕✁❙✏❘◗P★❖✏◆ ▼★▼✂❂✡✠ ✆ ✠✚▲❏■☛✡✠✆✠✁❑✻❏■✁❍● ❋❊❂✏❉✳❈❇❆❅✆❄❃✬❂✼★✼✸✷✶❝P❜ ✑☛❛❵ ✂✦❁❀☞✿★✿✁✏✾✽✼★✼ ✻ ✺ ✹✸ ✷ ✶✑☛❛❵✂✦❴✏❫★✒✵✴✳✲ ✱✏✰✯✬☛✮★✮✁✏✭✬☛✫✪✩★★ ❁ ❩❨ ✂❳ ❲❋ ❁ ❘ ❂✦▼★▼✂❂ ✡✠✆✠✁✟★❁❩✁★ ✧✤✤ ✏✰✯ ✬☛✮ ★✮ ✁✚✙✂✆ ✁✔✓✒✆✒✁✑☛✏✎✍✌☞✟✞✝✆✙✂ ✁❁❀✿★✿✁✾✽✭✬☛✫✪✩☎✄✡✠✖✕✁

Eg (9) expresses “In addition to promising an happy childhood, you have to think about how toare a series of detailed linguistic analyses on Le ( ),Zhe( )andGuo( ).The particle Le ( ) is generally considered a perfective marker, Guo ( ) is considered as experiential aspect (Xiao and McEnery, 2004), and perfective aspect according to Chen Qianrui (2003). Zhe ( ) is considered as the progressive aspect according to Chen Qianrui (2003), and durative aspect according to Xiao and McEnery(2004).Through the statistical analysis in BCC, we found the regular collocations with grammatical aspect markersLe( ),Zhe( )andGuo( )between Yòu( )andHái( ).promise children a prosperous”. Yòu (means [additional], not “again”. [additional]:“Yòu( )+V+Le( )+V”(10) Ling Dao Jian Le Lan Tang Shen Shi Huan Xi,DangXiaJiuAnPaiGongZuo,YouWenLe Wen Ta De Jia Ting Sheng Huo Qing Kuang () [The leader was so happy when he met Lan Tang, arranged work for her right away, andconsulted her family life].In sentence (10), the semantic background of “You Wen Le Wen Ta De Jia Ting Sheng Huo Qing Kuang ( )[and the leader consulted her family life]” is “the leader was happy”, then “the leader arranged work for”. Yòu ( ) means [additional] here. Yòu ( ) can be replaced by Hái ( ).To sum up, we draw the conclusion that each one of the two adverbs has its own prominent characteristic in semantic and syntactic compared with each other. The prominent semantic features and syntactic patterns of Hái ( ) and Yòu ( ) are as follows: Yòu has obvious advantages in matching v+Le ( ) +v and derogatory verbs. The prominent semantic feature of Yòu ( ) is [repetition]. Hái ( ) has absolute superiority in collocation with v+ Bu( ) + v, the prominent of Hái ( ) is [durative].) here   Le Zhe Guo freq freq freqHáiYòu Total382395742970 112536570056 216600 5332 70056 26992Table 6: Collocation with Aspect MarkersHái ( ) Yòu ( )  120% 100% 80% 60% 40% 20% 0%100%         34%66%        0%80.20%19.80%pct Guo( ) 3 3.1Collocation with Aspect Markers and Corresponding Semantic FeaturesCollocation Data with Le, Zhe and GuoFigure 2: Proportional Distribution FromTable6, inthecaseofLe( ),wecansee Yòu ( )+Le ( ) occupies the largest number, 742970 in total. That because Yòu ( ) shows its own semantic feature [repetition], which is compatible with Le ( ). For Zhe ( ), obviously, only Hái ( ) dominates the collocation.From an overall perspective, we can see the different collocations with the grammatical aspect markers. Le ( ) occupies the highest percentage with each adverb. Zhe ( ) is inclined to match Hái ( ), that is because Zhe ( ) is a durative aspectAccording to Gong Qianyan (1994) and Ma Qingzhu(2004), time adverbs can represent abundant aspect and tense systems in Mandarin Chinese. The syntax pattern of aspect system in Mandarin Chinese is {Adverbs+V+Dynamic Auxiliary}. So adverbs have important aspectual functions.

 and [durative] is the exclusive feature of Hái ( ). Due to the semantic compatibility of grammatically adjacent words, Hái ( ) and Zhe ( ) are compatible. The adverbs have different meanings when they collocate with aspect markers. From table 7 below, we can see that Hái ( )100% expresses [additional] when collocating with Le ( )(12) Zhong Guo Xin Li Xue Bao Yi Ti Chang Ke Xue De Xin Li Xue Wei Zong Zhi , Nei Rong Yi Kan Deng Shi Yan Bao Gao Wei Zhu, Ci Wai Hai Kai Pi Le Xue Shu Tao Lu, Shu Bao Jie Shao, Xin Wen Bao Dao Deng Zhuan Lan.

Hái ( ) has obvious advantages in matching Zhe ( ) and Guo ( ). Yòu ( )+V+Le ( ) tends to indicate [repetition], and Hái ( )+Zhe ( ) 100% express [durative]. This study is beneficial to the study of aspect functions of time adverbs and language learning to a certain extent. On the other hand, Chinese adverbs are more complicated than described, so we still need further study.AcknowledgmentsThe study is supported by 1) National Language Committee Research Project (Grant No.WT125- 45). 2) The Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, and the Research Funds of Beijing Language and Culture University (No.15YCX101). 3) Science Foundation of Beijing Language and Culture University (supported by “the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities”) (13ZDY03)ReferencesChen Qianrui. 2005.

( .) [the smoke hazard happened once]”.As a result, Yòu ( ) and Hái (different semantic features when collocating with grammatical aspect markers Le ( ), Zhe ( ) and Guo ( ). The different distributions of semantics and collocations have a close relation with their prominent semantic features.4 ConclusionsThis study applies the method of corpus linguistics and computational linguistics, combines with the comparison methods and semantic background model. Based on the observation of a large number of data and analyses of the language facts, we point out that Yòu ( ) and Hái ( ) have their own prominent semantic features and syntactic patterns compared with each other. The differences also reflect in the combination with grammatical aspect markers. The aspect functions of Yòu ( ) and Hái ( ) have a close relation with their semantic features.In this study, Hái ( ) has absolute superiority in collocation with V + Bu ( ) + V, which tends to express [durative]. Yòu ( ) tends to express [repetition] when collocating with V+ Le ( ) + V, express [repetition, derogatory] when collocating with derogatory verbs. The verbs modified by Yòu ( ) express a derogatory sense.We also studied the collocation with grammatical aspectmarkersLe( ),Zhe( )andGuo( ).) represent..2005.)Chen, Meiling 1992.
