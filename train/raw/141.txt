 Lexical Semantic Constraints on the Syntactic Realization of Semantic Role PossessorAbstractBased on a large-scale tagged corpus, this paper generalizes the syntactic-semantic patterns of the semantic role Possessor, its corresponding relation with lexical semantic category and syntactic element as well as the characteristics of lexical semantic constraints on its syntactic realization. All is based on accurate statistical data, which can facilitate automatic Chinese syntactic analysis and semantic understanding.1 IntroductionChinese lack of morphological changes. Chinese parts of speech and syntactic elements do not have one-to-one correspondence. When a word is used in a sentence, the syntactic element it serves and its semantic role are not certain. What’s more, syntactic structure and the syntactic semantic relations it contains are not consistent but quite complicated. Thus, there will be insurmountable difficulty if one analyzes Chinese syntactic structure to understand the syntactic meaning by beginning with part of speech. But the lexical semanticSecond AuthorAffiliation / Address line 1 Affiliation / Address line 2 Affiliation / Address line 3        email@domaincategory of a word is stable. So this study aims to start with lexical semantic category of a word to deduce its syntactic element and semantic role so as to achieve the goal of syntactic analysis and semantic understanding. It will take the lexical semantic category of a word, the syntactic elements it serves and its semantic role into consideration. Based on the statistics of a large-scale tagged corpus, this paper mainly studied the lexical semantic constraints when semantic role is mapped to syntactic element.Based on the related researches in the field, we defined the syntactic elements, semantic roles and the labels as follows:   Labels Meaning    Labels   Meaning   S  Subject chunk     D     Adverbial Chunk    P Predicate Chunk   C   Complement Chunk    OObject chunk  J Concurrent Chunk   A   Attributive chunk     T     Independent Chunk  Table 1.

So far Possessor has been mentioned by some scholars and institutions, including Shao Jingmin (1997), Lin Xingguang (1999), Lu Chuan (2001), Sinica Treebank by Academia Sinica of Taiwan, HowNet by Dong Zhendong & Dong Qiang, Labeled Chinese Syntactic-semantic Corpus by Ludong University, etc. In addition, Mr. Shi Youwei(1984) proposed a term " 领 属 " (Lingshu, literally it means “possession”)—a semantic case with referential markers as its core, which is different from Possessor. Other scholars doing ontology study provided roughly the same or similar definition for Possessor which refers to both the subject in the possessive relationship and the entirety in the whole-part relationship. In the engineering system, Possessor only refers to the subject in the possessive relationship, while entirety in the whole-part relationship usually is elaborated by other semantic roles. Possessor in this study is similar to those in ontology study, but our definition is more general: It refers to the subject that has possessive relation in an event and stands in opposition to objective, with the verb taking the meaning of “possessing” or “owning”. For example, [S 我/r]L[P 有/v]V[O 一/m 本/q 书]K, literally it means [S I/r]L[P have/v]V[O a/m measure word/q book]K.2 Possessor’s Syntactic-semantic PatternsPossessor’s syntactic-semantic patterns can be divided into 6 types,they are SLPV(Pattern meansthat Possessor L serves as the syntactic subject S, verb V serves as predicate P) > JLPV > PVSL > PVOL > OLPV > PVJL, please see the table below for details.Table2. Semanticrolesandlabels    Label Number Patterns  Number    Total   Percent    1   SLPV   1040     1107     93.95%    2JLPV 24  1107 2.17%    3 PVSL  19    1107   1.72%    4   PVOL   15     1107     1.36%    5OLPV 6  1107 0.54%    6   PVJL   3     1107     0.27%    Total  1107  1107 100.00% Table 3. Distribution of syntactic-semantic patternsThe statistics in the table reveal that Possessor can also be mapped to concurrent and object in addition to subject.First of all, Possessor is mapped to subject. There are 1059 such uses, accounting for 95.66% of the total. Some sentences are inverted. The following is a detailed classification.(1) SLPV Most of the Possessor follows this pattern when mapped to subject. There are 1040 such uses, accounting for 93.95% of the total. For example:1可是/c[S 他/r]L1D2[P 有/v]V1[O 足够/a 的/u 勇气/n]K1[D 把/p 今天/t 的/u 功课/n]KB2[P 坚持到底/l]V2。Literal translation: But/c[S He/r]L1D2[P has/v]V1[O enough/a attributive marker/u courage/n]K1[D ba, a preposition followed by the object of the verb /p today/t attributive marker/u homework/n]KB2[P hold on to the end/l]V2.
 (2)PVSL In this pattern the predicate is fronted, therefore forming a predicate-subject pattern. There are also examples which run across clauses. There are 19 such uses, accounting for 1.72% of the total number of subject. For example:2 [P 没 有 /v]V1[O 爱 /vn]K1[S 你 /r]L1L2[D 就/d[P 没有/v]V2[O 欢乐 /an]K2,[S 你/r]S3[D 就/d[D 不/d[D 愿 /v[P 游玩/v]V3。Literal translation: [P without/v]V1[O love/vn]K1[S you/r]L1L2[D then /d[P haveno/v]V2[O joy/an]K2 , [S you/r]S3[D will/d[D not/d[D be willing/v[P to strollabout/v]V3.3[P 有/v 了/u]V1[O 这个/r 信念/n]K1,[S我们/r]L1S2[D 将/d[D 能/v[D 把/p 这个 /r 国家/n 刺耳/a 的/u 争吵声 /n]OB2D3 , [P 改 变 /v]V2[P 成 为 /v]V3[O 一/m 支/q 洋溢/v 手足/n 乊/u 情/n 的/u 优美/a 交响曲/n]X3。Literal translation: [P have /v le, auxiliary word marking perfect tense /u]V1[O this/rbelief/n]K1 , [S we/r]L1S2[D will/d[D beable to/v[D ba, a preposition followed by the object of the verb /p this /r country/n harsh/a attributive marker/u arguing/n] OB2D3, [P change /v] V2[P into/v] V3[O a/m measure word/q full of /v hands and feet /n attributive marker/u affection/n attributive marker/u beautiful/a symphony/n]X3.Second, Possessor is mapped to concurrent. There are 27 such uses, accounting for 2.44% of the total. It is further divided into two sub-patterns.(1)JLPV This pattern ranks the second among all the Possessor’s syntactic- semantic patterns. There are 24 Possessors used as concurrent, accounting for 2.17% of the total. For example:4[P 让/v]V1[J 他们/r]O1+L2S3L4S5[D 既 /d[P 没 有 /v]V2[O 淡 水 /n]K2O3[P 喝/v]V3,[D 也/d[P 没有/v]V4[O 淡水 /n]K4[P 种/v]V5[O 庄稼/n]O5。Literal translation: [P let/v]V1[J them/r]O1+L2S3L4S5[D neither /d[P have/v]V2[O fresh water/n]K2O3[P to drink/v]V3, [D nor/d[P have /v]V4[O fresh water/n]K4[P to plant/v]V5[O crops/n]O5.In this example, “让”(rang, literally translatedinto “let”) means “to cause, to permit, to allow”. It has to be followed by concurrent.(2)PVJL There are 3 such uses, accounting for 0.27% of the total. Their predicates bear such semantic feature as belonging. For example:5[S 这/r 虾/n]K1[D 照例/d[D 是/d[P 归 /v]V1[J 我/r]L1+S2[P 吃/v]V2 的/u。Literal translation: [S this/r shrimp/n]K1[D as usual/d[D should /d[P belong to /v]V1[J us/r]L1+S2[P to eat/v]V2 attributive marker/u.Third, Possessor is also mapped to object. There are 21 such uses, accounting for 1.90% of the total. Possessors as object include the following two sub- patterns.(1)PVOL Verb-core structure (VS) in PVOL bear such semantic feature as [+ belonging] or [+ constituting]. There are 15 such uses, accounting for 1.36% of the total. For example:6[D 莫非/d,[S 艺术/n]K[D 是/d[P 属于 /v]V[O{弱者/n}@、{失败者/n}@]L 的/u?Literal translation: [D can it be that/d, [S art/n]K[D is/d[P belong to /v]V[O{ the weak/n}@, {the loser/n}@]L attributivemarker/u?(2)OLPV In this pattern, Possessor is semantically related to verb-core structure cross sentences. Object here means that noun-core structure (NS) plays the role of object in the preceding clause. There are 6 such uses, accounting for 0.54% of the total. For example:7[S 他/r]S1[P 做/v]V1[O 各种/r 事/n]O1L2,[P 有/v]V2[O 各种/r 意义/n]K2,... ...Literal translation: [S he/r]S1[P does/v]V1[O various kinds of /r things/n]O1L2,[P have /v]V2[O various/r significances/n]K2, ......
 3 Corresponding Relations between the3.1 Observation from Major Semantic CategoryThe statistic table below shows the mapping of Possessor from lexical semantic categories to syntactic elements.Syntactic Possessor CategoriesElements Mapped by and Lexical Semantic    Semantic categoryPossessor as Subject SLPV, PVSL  Possessor as Concurrent JLPV, PVJL    Possessor as object OLPV, PVOL  A human being     477 14    7  B object     207   4     8   C time and space  37  2  D abstract things     271   7     4   E features  420  0  F movement     1   0     0   G psychological activity  20  0  H activity     11   1     0   I phenomenon & state  61  0  J relevance     5   0     0   K expletive  00  0  L honorific     0   0     0   TOTAL   1059  27   21  Table 4. Mapping distribution of the major semantic categoriesFrom the table we can see the mapping capacity of each semantic category is different, which is shown by inequation as follows:Semantic categories for Possessor as subject: A>D>B>E>C>>H>I> J> G>F>K=FSemantic categories for Possessor as concurrent: A> D>B >H=ISemantic categories for Possessor as object: B> A> D >CFor Possessor as subject and concurrent, their semantic categories share a sequence: A>D>B>H. But for Possessor as object, there is a bit change, and the sequence is B>A>D>C, which can be explained by the fact that most of the semantic categories for Possessor as object are object. Though there are lots of semantic categories that play the role of Possessor, they, relatively speaking, are focused on A (human being), D(abstract things), B(object), E(features) and C(time and space), accounting for 97.56% of the total. Category E ranks fourth, for we marked “这(this)、那 (that)、各(each)„„”as Ed61, which is quite similar to the case of Theme.This can be further observed from the first 10 words in the noun-core word frequency list.(1)我\91;(2)他\67;(3)我们\44;(4)它 \40;(5)人\36;(6)她\30;(7)你\27;(8)他们 \20;(9)这\17;(10)花\15;Literal translation: I\91 ; (2)he, him\67 ; (3)we, us\44;(4)it\40;(5)human being\36; (6)she , her\30 ; (7)ni, meaning “you”\27 ; (8)they\20;(9)this\17;(10)flower\15;The word frequency statistics show that those words that precede others are nearly all pronouns, with A, D, B and H accounting for some percent. There are 124 words that occur more than twice with 746 word tokens, accounting for 67.39% of the total.In addition to Ed, there are also Eb(three)and Ee(two). In Eb, words are pronouns. In Ee, words are adnouns. For example:8[S 有的/r]L 则/c[P 微带/v]V[O 黄色 /n]K。Literal translation: [S Some/r]L then/c[P slightly takes on/v]V[O yellow/n]K.
 9要是/c[P 没有/v]V1[O 愚钝/an]K1,[S 机 智/an]L2[D 还/d[P 有/v]V2[O 什么/r 光荣/an]K2 呢/y?Literal translation: If /c[P there is no/v]V1[O slow-witted man/an]K1,[S the witty one/an]L2[D will/d[P have/v]V2[O what/rhonour/an]K2 auxiliary word/y?Actually, besides human beings and object, C(time and space) can also possess and own things. For example:10... ... [S 每个/r 时代/t]L2[D 都/d[P 有 /v]V2[O 很/d 多/a 这样/r 有/v 骨气/n 的/u人/n]K2。(时代: Ca01)Literal translation: [S each/r era/t]L2[D all/d[P has/v]V2[O quite/d a lot of/a such /r have/v moral integrity/n attributive marker/u men/n]K2.(era: Ca01)In the table above, Category F, G, H, I and J also account for a small part. The occurrence of such verb semantic category is due to the difference in part of speech at lexical level and syntactic level. That is to say, at the lexical level, they are verbs (semantic category in Cilin is built on such level), but at the syntactic level, they are changed into nouns. For example:11○... ... [S 小/a 睡/vn]L3[D 也/d[D 别/d[P 有/v]V3[O 风味/n]K3 的/y]U。Literal translation: [S a little/a sleep/vn]L3[D also/d[D quite/d[P has/v]V3[O special flavor/n]K3 attributive marker/y]U.(sleep: Fd03 , the syntactic context activates its referentiality so it plays the role of a noun. In fact “小睡”,literally it means “sleep for a short while or nap”, can also be considered as a noun.)Possessors differ in their capacity as syntactic elements. So do the mapping capacity of their lexical semantic categories. When Possessor is mapped to subject and concurrent, the mapping priority or mapping strength of semantic categories is also different. For Possessor, words of some semantic categories show a stronger capacity than words of other semantic categories in fulfilling thefunction of subject, concurrent and object. Generally speaking, subject and concurrent prefer semantic category “human beings”. When words from category “human beings” serve as Possessor, they are first of all mapped to subject ad concurrent. Object prefers “object”, so words from Category “object” are first mapped to object.3.2 Observation from Medium Semantic CategoryWe also furthered our study in medium semantic category. The following statistic table shows the distribution of Possessor’s medium semantic categories.From statistics we can conclude the sequence of the first 20 semantic categories that are realized as Possessor, they are:Aa (general reference) > Dk (culture and education) > Ba (general term) > Di (society, politics and law) > Da (things and conditions) > Ed (nature) > Bh(plants) > Bg(natural object) > Cb(space) > Ah(relatives) > Ab(man, women, young and old) > Bi(animal) > Db(reason and logic) > Bd(celestial body) > Bn(buildings) > Ca(time) > Dd(property) > Bk(whole body) > Be(landform) > Df(consciousness)Except for Ed that is quite special, Category A(human beings), D(abstract things), B(object) and C(time and space) are first realized as Possessor. Other categories rank after 30th. When the first 33 categories are considered, there are 1059 such preferential uses, accounting for 95.65% of the total, which shows that human beings, object, time and space are preferred when mapped to Possessor.There are 95 medium semantic categories in Cilin, but 36 categories cannot be projected to the syntactic elements served by Possessor, accounting for 37.89%. Yet words from the remaining categories can be projected.To have a clear picture of the projection of the lexical semantic categories of the head of Possessor phrase, we made a table below to show how they are mapped to subject, concurrent and object.  Semantic Category     Subject   Concurrent     Object   Semantic Category      Subject    Concurrent     Object

Mapping distribution of the medium semantic categoriesHorizontally, according to the semantic categories that can be projected to the syntactic elements served by Possessor, we can generalize the following three types of projection.1) Full projectionSemantic categories in this type can be projected to any syntactic element served by Possessor. It consists of 5 semantic categories: Aa (general reference), Af(identity), Ba(general term), Da(things and conditions), Dk(culture and education).2) Zero projection. Semantic categories that belong to this type can not be projected to any syntactic element served by Possessor. This type includes 36 categories, they are: Ac(posture), Bb(quasi substance),Bc(parts of the object), Bj(microorganism), Bl(excreta, secreta), etc.3) Restricted projection. Semantic categories that belong to this type can be selectively projected to the syntactic elements served by Possessor. There are 54 semantic categories such as Ab, Ad, etc.Vertically, 58 semantic categories can be mapped as subject, 11 categories be mapped as concurrent, 5 categories as object. That is to say, words serving as Possessor are first mapped as subject.Part of speech plays an important role in disambiguating word sense and labeling semantic roles. The statistic table below shows Possessor’s parts of speech.   POS for NS  Number     Percent POS for NS  Number    Percent POS for NS   Number    Percent   n  586     52.94% Ng  4    0.36% Tg   2    0.18%   r  416     37.58% s  4    0.36% a   1    0.09%   nr    43      3.88%    an   3     0.27%   m    1      0.09%   vn 20  1.81%f 3  0.27%nt 1  0.09%   ns    11      0.99%    t   3     0.27%                v  7  0.63% nz  2  0.18%     From the table above, we can see words serving as Possessor involve 16 kinds of parts of speech, including nouns, pronouns, personal names(nr), verb noun, location noun(ns), adnoun, totaling 1076, accounting for 97.20% of the total. This shows that most of the words serving as Possessor are nouns and pronouns. The occurrence of v and a is caused by the change of part of speech.4. Characteristics of lexical Semantic Constraints on the Syntactic Realization of Possessor4.1 Semantic Features of Predicate Verbs that Collocate with PossessorThe syntactic realization of semantic roles is a process in which noun-core structure semantic category and verb-core structure semantic category constrain each other reciprocally. It is not enough if we consider the constraints only from the perspective of Possessor. The table below shows the distribution of verb-core structure related to Possessor.Table 7. Statistics of Possessor’s parts of speech
    Major Semantic Category     Number      Total     Percent     Cumulative Percent   J relevance 842  1107 76.06% 76.06%   K expletive     202      1107     18.25%     94.31%   H activity 48  1107 4.34% 98.64%   I phenomenon and state     10      1107     0.90%     99.55%   E features 4  1107 0.36% 99.91%   G psychological activity     1      1107     0.09%     100.00%   Total  1107   1107 100.00%   According to the number of verb-core structure semantic categories that collocate with Possessor, we can see such a sequence: J(relevance) > K(expletive) > H(activity) > I(phenomenon and state) > E(feature) > G(psychological state). This indicates that verbs that collocate with Possessor need have such semantic features as [+relevance], [+activity], [+phenomenon and state], [+feature],[+psychological state], etc. This can be clearly illustrated by the following chart.The statistic table below shows the relation between verb-core structure semantic categories and the syntactic elements served by Possessor. It can help us get a better picture of the mapping of different verb-core structure semantic categories to syntactic elements served by Possessor.Table 8.

Distribution of VS medium semantic categoriesAccording to the number of verb-core structure medium semantic categories that collocate with Possessor, we can find such a sequence: Jd(existence) > Ka(degree) > Hj(life) > Ja(contact) > He(economic activity) > Ib (physiological phenomenon) = Id (state of object) > Eb (representation) > Ie (state of affairs) > Ed(nature) = Gb (psychological activity) =Je (influence).In the table above, in Jd it is Jd04(have, possess) and Jd06 (be filled with, be full of, contain, manifest, appear) that collocate with Possessor, and both have such semantic feature as [+ possess]. In Ka(degree), it is Ka18(no, not) that collocate with Possessor, and it has such semantic feature as [+ not have]. In Hj(life), it is Hj36(carry, follow)that collocate Possessor. In specific sentences it is often served by “带”(dai, literally it means “take”) which has such semantic feature as [+ possess]. In Ja(contact), it is only Ja06(be attributed to, belong to) that collocate with Possessor, and it also has such semantic feature as [+ possess]. In He(economic activity), collocation with Possessor is focused on He14(enough, counterbalance, remainder, balance, in debt) and He15(lack, omit), both having such semantic feature as [+ possess] or [+ not have]. This is true of other medium semantic categories. So they will not be discussed here.From the above analysis of the VS major semantic categories and medium semanticcategories that collocate with Possessor, we can conclude that all the verb-core structure semantic categories that collocate with Possessor have such semantic features as [+have] or [-have].4.2 Semantic Features of Words Servings as PossessorBy analyzing verb-core semantic categories that collocate with Possessor, we can generalize Possessor’s semantic features as follows: a. independence. Possessor has independence, which means things it refers to exist independently prior to the event expressed by the verb; b. non- autonomy. It means that Possessor cannot be the doer of the action or the behavior, and that Possessor only refers to the subject expressing the possessive relations.Generally speaking, B(object) first realizes patient. Then why does it rank the second in this study? From the verb semantic categories that collocate with B, we can see that in this study they manifest such features as personification and wholeness rather than passivity, thus making it subject with semantic feature [+ possess].4.3 Collocation Rules of Noun-core Structure and Verb-core StructureLexical semantic constraints on the syntactic realization of semantic roles are also reflected in the collocation rules of noun-core structure
 semantic categories and verb-core structure dimensional table shows the collocation rules of semantic categories. The following two- semantic categories of Possessor.   Semantic category    A B     C D  E  F    G  H I   J     K   L   Total   E      1   /      /    3   /   /     /    /  /    /       /      /     4   F  //  // / /  / // /  / / /   G    1 /     / /  /  /    /  / /   /     /   /   1   H      23   17      /    5   2   /     /    1  /    /       /      /     48   I  35  11 / /  / / /  / / 10   J    336 172     30 246  37  1    2  8 6   4     /   /   842   K      134   25      8    27   3   /     /    3  1    1       /      /     202   L  //  // / /  / // /  / / /   Total     498 219      39  282   42  1    2  12 7    5              1107 Table11. CollocationrulesofNSandVSsemanticcategoriesFrom the table above, horizontally we can see Category J can collocate with any other semantic category of noun-core structure except for L and K. Vertically, no semantic category of noun-core structure can freely collocate with those of verb-core structure. Only Category A, D, B and C have more collocationsthanothers,accountingfor93.85% ofthe total. This means Possessor is mainly realized by Category A, D, B and C. The top ten rules are: A+J(336) > D+J(246) > B+J(172) > A+K (134) > E+J(37) > C+J(30) > D+K(27) > B+K(25) > A+ H(23) > B+H(17), accounting for 97.76% of the total. Possessor’s collocation rules with verb-core structure semantic categories are comparatively concentrated, which is quite conducive to the making of exclusive rules.ReferencesWordNet: http://wordnet.princeton.edu/.Changlai Chen.
