 The Innovative Development of Taiwan Hakka Symbolic Code <nganggiang stiff neck> in Media DiscourseAbstractThis study investigates the innovative devel- opment of the symbolic code <nganggiang stiff neck> into an iconographic reference, profiling its meaning representation and extension in media discourse. Employing text-analysis tools, the study retrieves 3265 tokens from the four major newspapers in Taiwan society, Udndata, Knowledge Management Winner, Liberty Times Net, and Apple Daily. The data are ana- lyzed regarding their longitudinal distribution, theme distribution and the cross distribution across four dimensions. The main findings are as follows. First, the meaning of <nganggiang stiff neck>, used to carry negative connotation, has turned into a symbolic code with positive connotation due to historical events contingent on the social-political development in Taiwan. Even since, denoting Hakka character as perse- verance, it has become a Hakka symbolic code stereotypically employed to depict Hakka- related matters, human or non-human, strongly indicating ideological effect in media discourse toward Hakka groups. Second, its semiotic in- novation continues to develop through mecha- nisms of metaphor and metonymy. With new ways of representing various themes in differ- ent news types, <nganggiang stiff neck> emerges as an iconographic reference repre- senting a simplistic image with familiar judg- ment and values, and carrying linguistic, se- mantic, affective, and pragmatic forces of the situation reported in the news. This study demonstrates a research integrating computa- tional and corpus methods for linguistic analy- sis of news discourse. The findings profile the importance of placing semiotic innovation in its social, cultural, political and historical contexts, highlighting the intertwining complexities be- tween media discourse, communication, and society.1. BackgroundMedia discourse uses culturally conventional symbols to create news stories to communicate. Among the symbols, language is the most salient one often employed to represent certain social im-ages (Weng et al. 1999). Since linguistic codes contain systematic and sensible connections of symbols and concepts, they play the most im- portant role in the process of meaning representa- tion in media discourse.Previous studies on Hakka images have found out that the lexical item in Hakka <nganggiang stiff neck> (a lexicalized item meaning tough, in- domitable) is often used by media to represent Hakka groups. To illustrate, Lee (2013) investi- gates how media represents Hakka images by ana- lyzing the news types, themes, directions and tones of three main newspapers China Times, United Daily News, and Liberal Times Net during the time period of June 14, 1995 and June 14, 2007. Her findings show that news about Hakka cultural images tend to be positively-oriented, and <ngang- giang stiff neck> is the most frequently used term to depict Hakka character. Similarly, Peng (2008) analyzes Hakka news reported in 2006 by the four main newspapers China Times, United Daily News, Liberal Times Net and Apple Daily in Taiwan. His findings show that Hakka news increases tremen- dously in 2006, and <nganggiang stiff neck> is one of the four adjectives mostly used in Hakka news. He claims that the results are due to media framing effects in that news media tend to use cer- tain linguistic forms to stereotypically depict the ethnic character of Hakka people. The lexical item <nganggiang stiff neck>, the most representative form, is hence the most frequently used for Hakka news.In fact, the word <nganggiang stiff neck> 「硬頸」is a unique lexical item in Taiwan Hakka, not found in Taiwan Mandarin or Taiwanese Southern Min. It used to denote someone being stubborn or bullheaded, carrying negative connota- tion. However, it is employed now in news dis- course as a symbolic code to represent Hakka im- age, carrying positive connotation. More interest- ingly, the meaning of this lexical item shows a spillover effect in media discourse under media framing, extending from Hakka to non-Hakka peo- ple, and even to non-human objects or abstract concepts. With regard to the observations, this study aims to delve into the following two ques-
 tions. What are the social-cultural factors that trig- ger such innovative development of the symbolic code <nganggiang stiff neck> in media discourse? How is this semiotic change actually brought about?2. Mechanisms for Semiotic InnovationThe compounding of the word <nganggiang stiff neck>, based on a bodily experience, arouses an image that is identifiable, understandable, em- pathetic and easy for sense making. Its accessibil- ity and uniqueness meet the needs for communica- tion and for innovation. Van Leeuwen (2005:26) claims that “[a]s a society changes, new semiotic resources and new ways of using existing semiotic resources may be needed”. Of the two layers of meaning, denotation and connotation, the latter with positive or negative implication carries a lan- guage user’s subjective and affective attitude (Barthes 1977). To represent such a connotative meaning for communication, metaphor and meton- ymy, two cognitive mechanisms for understanding abstract meanings, are the key principles. Metaphor and metonymy are deemed to be concep- tual connecting language and thought. Conceptual metaphor and conceptual metonymy are under- stood on the basis of our concrete bodily experi- ence (Lakoff & Johnson 1980). Metaphor is con- ceptual and systematic, employing concepts of the concrete source domain to understand those of the abstract target domain. Table 1 illustrates the map- pings of the metaphor LOVE IS A JOURNEY.Source domain: JOURNEY       Target domain: LOVEmains and target domains; metaphor is domain- external and metonymy is domain-internal.Conceptual metaphor and metonymy empha- size the thinking process and the systematic map- pings of source domains and target domains. Cam- eron & Deignan (2006: 673), however, point out that linguistic phenomena are not that systematic as actual usages are examined in the corpus. Take FIRE metaphor example. While the plural form flames are often used to represent anger or love, the singular form flame is used to represent belief or ideal. The word burning represents ambition or desire, but ignite represents war. Linguistic usages are full of inconsistent and unsystematic mappings. In addition, cultural differences often bring out different emotional or affective attitudes. They hence maintain that metaphor should take both language and thought into consideration. In other words, they maintain that metaphor should be ana- lyzed both linguistically and conceptually in its discourse context and within its social-cultural context.In fact, the accessibility and application of corpora not only give rise to a change of research paradigm of metaphor and metonymy but also bring to the fore the importance of the actual dis- course situation in which metaphor or metonymy is used. Linguistic innovation occurs under the influ- ence of its social-cultural background, often carry- ing strong emotional and affective forces. Hawkins (2001) coins the term iconographic reference as follows: “Iconographic reference is a common mode of textual representation which represents simplistic images of our experiences and does so in such a way as to underscore familiar values which interlocutors in a particular discourse are implicitly expected to endorse. The effect of iconographic reference is to establish a powerful conceptual link between the referent and a particular value judg- ment” (32). Dirven et al. (2003:3) also claim that “[iconographic reference] can be understood as the metaphorical pendant of a stereotype in that it is a representation based on simplistic images of the targeted people, groups, or ideas, and associated with familiar values, either positive or negative ones”. The claims highlight the significance of us- ing authentic materials for research that relies heavily on using corpora. Such an analysis is only possible when a certain amount of data from cor- pora is analyzed. To this end, we need to have effi-  the travelersthe journeythe obstacles encountereddecisions about which way to gothe destination of the journeythe loversevents in the relationshipthe difficulties experiencedchoices about what to dothe goals of the relationship     Table 1. LOVE IS A JOURNEYKövecses and Radden(1998)claim that me- tonymy is also conceptual, manifested as a projec- tion between a source concept and target concept within an experiential domain. For instance, in the case He likes Shakespeare, a metonymy AUTHOR FOR WORK is triggered. In short, both metaphor and metonymy involve mappings of source do-
 cient and effect text analysis tools. The next sec- tion presents the methodology.3. Methodology 3.1 MaterialThe data are retrieved from four major news- papers online data bases in Taiwan: Udndata (聯合 知識庫), Knowledge Management Winner (KMW 知識贏家), Liberty Times Net (自由新聞網) and Apple Daily (蘋果日報). News with the keyword <nganggiang stiff neck 硬頸> is collected. The time period available for search in each corpus var-ies. In total, 2554 items of news with 1972589 characters are retrieved, as shown in Table 2.1st line2nd line3rd line4th line5th lineHeadlineSubheadingNews TypeSub-typeJournalistTable 3.

Token distribution    In order to create consistent text files for text analysis, all the retrieved news are constructed based on the metadata format shown in Table 3. The four newspapers use different news categories to categorize their news. In order to maintain con- sistent categorization, we reorganize news catego- ries and sub-categories based on the themes of the news content for the retrieved data. The news cate- gories are given in Table 4. In total, 3265 tokens are retrieved, and the distribution from each corpus is given in Table 5. Then all the tokens are ana- lyzed into four dimensions: Hakka/human, Hakka/non-human, non-Hakka/human, and non- Hakka/non-human. The next section reports the results.4. ResultsThe results are reported in Figure 1, Table 6, Table 7, and Figure 2. Figure 1 shows the yearly distribution of <nganggiang stiff neck> in each corpus. Since Udndata has the most complete cov- erage of the years, its distribution reveals the most holistic picture. Between the 38 years of 1955- 1993, only 16 tokens are found, and the first peak emerges during 1993-1994. A drastic rise occurs during 1998-1999, and similar rises occur during 2002-2003, 2006-2007, and 2010-2012. Table 6 shows the distribution in news categories, with culture & art, politics, and lifestyles occupying the
 top three. Table 7 shows the distribution of the four dimensions: the contrast of Hakka to non-Hakka is around 65% to 35%; the contrast of human to non- human is also 65% to 35%. Finally, Figure 2 shows the different years for the emergence of <nganggiang stiff neck> in different categories and whether <nganggiang stiff neck> maintains being used after the emergence. The figure shows that it first emerges in culture & art and steadily exists in this category. It is largely used in politics in 1994, followed by education & technology, business, entertainment, lifestyles, and sports. Alt- hough politics and education & technology use it more or less at the same time in 1994, it is much more favored by politics as it still actively occurs after 1994 in politics. The two lines (solid red for politics; solid light blue for education & technolo- gy) distinguish each other very clearly after 1995 with the former persisting and the latter declining.Human Non-human TotalHakka1282 (39.24%) 870 (26.62%) 2142 (65.86%)Non-hakka864 (26.52%) 249 (7.62%)1113 (34.14%)Total2146 (65.76%) 1119 (34.24%) 3265 (100%)                    Table 7. Cross Distribution  Figure1. Yearly distributionRegarding the first research question, what so- cial-cultural factors trigger the innovative devel- opment of <nganggiang stiff neck> from carrying negative connotation to carrying positive connota- tion? The yearly distribution in Figure 1 indicates that Hakka news increases around 1990, and a sharp rise occurs during 1993-1994. An examina- tion of Hakka Movement back then gives an an- swer. Figure 3 shows the three stages of Hakka Movement—the stage of Emergency, that of Growth, and that of Maturity (cf. Luo 2008).Figure2. Expansion to categories5.

  Figure3. Stages of Hakka MovementTwo important events are very influential dur- ing the emergent stage—Give My Mother Tongue Back in 1988, and the establishment of Association of Taiwan Hakka Public Affairs in 1990. The first president of the Association is Zhao-zheng Zhong, a famous Hakka figure whose presidential speech strongly advocates New Hakka concept, encourag- ing Hakka people to bring Hakka spirit into full play, to be proud of being Hakka, and to loudly speak their own language so as to pass Hakka lan- guage down to generations. His presidential speech and his strong appeal to the concept New Hakka have turned the word <nganggiang stiff neck> over, making it undergo semantic elevation. The following lines of his speech are monumental:客家人多以「硬頸」自許、自傲...從這一 刻起再次挺起你硬鐵的頸骨,表示你是客 家子弟,說你的母語,把你的母語傳給下 一代...kèjiārén duō yǐ yìngjǐng zìxǔ zìào...Cóng zhèyíkè qǐ zàicì tǐngqǐ nǐ yìngtiěde jǐnggǔ biǎoshì nǐshì kèjiāzǐdì shuō nǐde mǔyǔ bǎ nǐde mǔyǔ chuán gěi xiàyídài (Hakka-people-often-take-stiff neck-self ex- pect-self proud...from-this-moment-on-again- straighten-your-hard-neck-show-you are -Hakka descendant-speak-your-mother tongue -BA-your-mother tongue-pass down-next generation)‘Hakka people often take pride in owning the spirit of indomitability.... From now on, keep your neck straight! Show that you are Hakka descendants! Speak your mother tongue! Pass down your mother language to next genera- tions!’Ever since, the word <nganggiang stiff neck> has become associated with positive meanings like toughness and perseverance. It also becomes a symbolic code representing Hakka character, and gradually develops into an iconographic reference to stand for a simplistic image with value judg- ments. Such an innovative development is contin- gent with an ideology. The highest occurrence in culture & art in Table 6 shows that more straight news related to Hakka are reported in the media. The fact that Hakka affairs occupy almost 65% in Table 7 also reveals stereotypical impressions to- ward Hakka issues in the news. On the other hand, the results show that <nganggiang stiff neck> is often manipulated by media discourse to depict politicians for political purposes. The several rises in Figure 1 correspond to the two or three years before presidential elections in Taiwan. This strongly implies how Hakka issues are raised and manipulated for political reasons during the cam- paign since Hakka people are known as the swing votes that could have decisive effects of win or lose. Evidence also comes from Figure 2 that shows how politics is the domain that most active- ly uses this item.Under media framing effects, <nganggiang stiff neck> keeps on expanding its usages in differ- ent frames, functioning as a handy attractor in me- dia discourse. What mechanisms bring about such an extension? Its meaning extends, through meta- phor and metonymy, from portraying Hakka char- acter to stereotypically representing Hakka non- human objects or concepts, even to representing non-Hakka people and non-Hakka objects or con- cepts. For instance, it is used to report news about tung flowers or Hakka blue shirts, described to im- ply the spirit of toughness or persistence. It is em- ployed in various news types, either portraying the protagonist’s perseverance or indomitability, or depicting the persistence or stability of certain ob- jects such as money currency or stock. The follow- ing headlines taken from Udndata can illustrate:
 裘莉硬頸挺難民Qiúlì yìngjǐng tǐng nànmín(Angelina Jolie-stiff neck-back up-refugees) Jolie strongly backs refugees up.傷兵不怕戰 尼克超硬頸Shāngbīng búpà zhàn níkè chāoyìngjǐng(wounded players-no-fear-fighting- Knicks extremely-stiff neck)‘The wounded players do not fear; New York Knicks Really tough!東京還是如此硬頸Dōngjīng háishì rúcǐ yìngjǐng(Tokyo-still-is-so-stiff neck) Tokyo is still so persistent!台泥登 50 元 水泥股硬頸táiní dēngwǔshíyuán shuǐnígǔ yìngjǐngTaiNi-climb up-NT50-dollars-cement stock -stiff neck)‘TaiNi climbs up to 50 dollars. The cement stock stands steadily!’An examination of the lexical item <ngang- giang stiff neck> will find out that the word itself is a metonymically lexicalized item. When we get stubborn and tough, we often make our necks stiff to convey our unyielding attitude. We often use our own bodily experience to metaphorically anal- ogize other abstract concepts. The referential do- mains of <nganggiang stiff neck> are expanded and shifted to different frames by the two princi- ples--metaphor and metonymy. The character of being tough or unyielding is used to depict non- Hakka people such as Angelina Jolie. Through the metonymy INSTITUTION FOR PEOPLE, it is used to refer to the team New York Knicks that stands for the players; through double metonymy PLACE FOR INSTITUTION FOR PEOPLE, it is used to refer to the capital city Tokyo to stand for the Japanese government and in turn to stand for the decision makers. And through personification it manifests analogical metaphor STOCK IS HU- MAN, depicting constancy or steadiness of stock. Table 8 gives the distribution of the frame expan- sions to different news categories through meton- ymy and metaphor. As illustrated by the headlines, <nganggiang stiff neck> becomes in media dis-course an iconographic reference with strong atti- tudinal judgments of the reported news.   Types World Politics Society Business Culture&Art Edu&Tech Lifestyles Entertainment Sports TotalMetonymy 14 (1.54%) 14 (1.54%) 35 (3.84%) 13 (1.43%) 683 (74.89%) 11 (1.21%) 118 (12.94%) 9 (0.99%)15 (1.64%) 912 (100%)Metaphor 8 (3.98%) 19 (9.45%) 3 (1.49%) 140 (69.65%) 9 (4.48%) 2 (1.00%) 15 (7.46%) 2 (1.00%) 3 (1.49%) 201 (100%)           Table8.

ConclusionIn this study, we investigate the innovative de- velopment of the symbolic code <nganggiang stiff neck> into an iconographic reference in media dis- course. Employing text analysis tools, the study retrieves 3265 tokens from the four major newspa- pers in Taiwan society, Udndata, Knowledge Man- agement Winner, Liberty Times Net, and Apple Daily. The data are analyzed regarding their longi- tudinal distribution, theme distribution and the cross distribution across four dimensions. The main findings are as follows. First, the meaning of <nganggiang stiff neck>, used to carry negative connotation, has turned into a symbolic code with positive connotation due to historical events con- tingent on the social-political development in Tai- wan. Even since, denoting Hakka character as per- severance, it has become a Hakka symbolic code stereotypically employed to depict Hakka-related matters, human or non-human, strongly indicating ideological effect in media discourse toward Hakka groups. Its frequency highly correlates with major political events in Taiwan, with high peaks occur- ring particularly two or three years before presi- dential elections. Second, its semiotic innovation continues to develop, extending from prototypical Hakka frames to Hakka non-human frames, to non- Hakka frames, and to non-Hakka non-human frames through mechanisms of metaphor and me- tonymy. With new ways of representing various themes ranging from international affairs, publici- ties in entertainment or sports to technology and stock or money currency, <nganggiang stiff neck>
 emerges as an iconographic reference representing a simplistic image with familiar judgment and val- ues, and carrying linguistic, semantic, affective, and pragmatic forces of the situation reported in the news. Figure 4 summarizes the semiotic inno- vation of this symbolic code with its frame shifts by metaphor and metonymy. Of course, such an extension will not happen without the manipulation of language users and the ideology embedded in the social-cultural context.Figure4. Semiotic innovationThis study demonstrates a research integrating computational and corpus methods for linguistic analysis of media discourse. The findings profile the importance of placing semiotic innovation in its social, cultural, political and historical contexts, highlighting the intertwining complexities between media discourse, communication, and society.ReferencesBarthes, R. 1977.
