AbstractThere is a striking lack of studies in linguistics tackling the intricate relationship between sarcasm and irony. On the other hand, corpora are used with gradual frequency to investigate these concepts with special emphasis on their implicit uses. The underlying assumption in the present study is that investigating the explicit uses is a more unbiased and expedient way of revealing potential differences between the two. Conversely, the present article details a systematic corpus-based comparison of sarcasm vs irony, sarcastic vs ironic, and sarcastically vs ironically focusing on their collocational behavior. Differences between the two terms are outstanding with respect to verb, adjective, and adverb collocations, polarity issues, and as regards the identity of the referent.1 IntroductionVenturing out into the territory of sarcasm and irony is a challenging pursuit: boundaries become blurry, cues are scarce, and the question what exactly constitutes sarcasm and irony seems to be an ever-recurring problem without any solid starting point. A relatively extensive literature exists on irony approaches from a linguistic viewpoint (e.g. Sperber and Wilson, 1981; Kreuz and Glucksberg, 1989; Attardo, 2000; Utsumi, 2000; Partington, 2007). However, the same cannot be claimed about sarcasm per se. Sarcasm and irony seem to go hand in hand and seem to be invariably treated together without any justification for them doing so. A general overview of the literature makes it apparent that: i) sarcasm andSecond AuthorAffiliation / Address line 1 Affiliation / Address line 2 Affiliation / Address line 3email@domainirony are considered interchangeable, synonymous terms, and ii) irony is believed to comprise all instances of sarcasm thus an account of irony necessarily includes that of sarcasm. The hypothesis proposed in this study is that sarcasm and irony are in fact different concepts and the differences come to light through corpus-based research focusing on the explicit uses of these terms. The study was carried out on scripted data bearing in mind that irony could refer to other than verbal instances (e.g. situational irony), whereas sarcasm could not. Thus, an analysis of the explicit uses of these terms and their lemmas would inevitably reveal certain distinguishing characteristics. Emphasis was lain on the collocational behavior of 3 word pairs (sarcasm- irony, sarcastic-ironic, and sarcastically-ironically), and the goal was to describe what was exclusive to the individual words. After a brief introduction of the relevant literature, section 3 will describe the methodological framework, hypothesis, and the data that were utilized. Section 4 and its subsections are entirely devoted to the analysis of the data and the discussion of the findings. Section 5 concludes the article summarizing the main points and suggesting further possibilities for research.2 Related WorkDespite being obviously related to each other, sarcasm and irony are not taken to be synonymous terms in this study. Already their etymology sets them apart: eironeia means dissimulation, assumed ignorance, whereas sarkasmos literally means “to strip off the flesh” (Online Etymology Dictionary,Explicitly about sarcasm and irony: A corpus-based investigation
 2001). The evident dissimilarity has gradually become less and less evident until we arrive to contemporary research where it seems to be a rather ambitious goal to actually enumerate the distinguishing features. A limited number of articles are dedicated to the scientific teasing apart of the two concepts (Kreuz and Glucksberg, 1989; Littman and Mey, 1993; Lee and Katz, 1998). Kreuz and Glucksberg (1989) draw on Sperber and Wilson’s (1981) influential irony theory and their primary goal is to differentiate between implicit and explicit antecedent events that trigger sarcasm. However, the reason why they choose the term sarcasm in their article to argue against a theory (i.e. Sperber & Wilson’s echoic mention theory of irony) that apparently does not consider sarcasm is not elaborated on. Littman & Mey (1993) point out what is an unarguable fact that whereas irony does not only manifest itself in the spoken realm but we talk about ironic situations (e.g. how ironic is it that...), the same is not true for sarcasm which only exists in the verbal realm. In other words, the phrase how sarcastic is it that... would be infelicitous. Lee & Katz (1998) assert that the difference lies in the identity of the victim which in the case of sarcasm is a specific person, whereas in the case of irony is numerous people. Without invalidating their claim, the present study will show how their conclusion can be extended to non- human referents too in the case of irony. There exist other studies concentrating on a certain aspect of sarcasm, such as emotions related to it (Leggitt & Gibbs, 2000; Rockwell, 2005), its discourse goals (Kreuz, 2000), or its acquisition (Creusere, 2000). None the less, there is a striking scarcity of corpus linguistic-based research, Partington (2007) being one of the few exceptions with his corpus- based study focusing, however, exclusively on irony. Sarcasm, and, by extension, the discrepancies between sarcasm and irony, seem to be a woefully neglected field of study.3 Methodology3.1 Framework and hypothesisThere is an evident research gap. Most of the abovementioned studies heroically attempt to tackle a highly pragmatic issue from various angles; however, have routinely failed to address the problem concerning the relationship of sarcasmwith irony (with the exception of a few studies). Corpus linguistics offers a fairly straightforward and much more unbiased way to get to the bottom of the “irony-sarcasm dilemma.” A corpus study allows the researcher to efficiently search for explicit uses of sarcasm and irony and allows the data to speak for itself without devising a theory beforehand. The goal is to shed light on the distinguishing features of explicit sarcasm and irony and provide ground for their being treated in their own right in the literature. The hypothesis is that these differences would manifest in the collocational behavior of these terms. The underlying idea, according to which irony allows for variety (e.g. situational irony, dramatic irony, etc.), while sarcasm does not was considered throughout.3.2 DataThe text collection employed for this research was a 135-million word soap opera corpus downloaded from the TVMegaSiteInc (2003); a website dedicated to providing transcripts of American daily soap operas by volunteers. The advantages of using soap opera transcripts are numerous: Soap operas are popular, their language is well- understood, they build on everyday communicative situations and personal interaction, and characters are modeled after real people and are thus similarly coherent and rounded. Moreover, the number of occurrences for each query made it possible to quantify the data but at the same time provide a qualitative analysis as well.4 Analysis and discussionThe corpus search involved six words: irony, ironic, ironically, sarcasm, sarcastic, and sarcastically. A summary of the keywords with the total number of tokens is shown in Table 1. The results were compared between word pairs (sarcasm vs irony, sarcastic vs ironic, and sarcastically vs ironically). Detailed analysis is given in separate subsections.
    keywordsarcasm irony sarcastic ironic sarcastically ironicallytotal309        498        247        938        19182sarcasm has more obvious negative connotations (stinging, cutting, bitter); whereas in the case of irony, negativity is not obvious from its etymology that emphasizes pretense and contradiction (Online Etymology Dictionary, 2001). Table 2 lists the adjective collocations and also shows in parentheses how many times a given adjective collocated with the word if it is more than one. Adjectives are categorized according to their polarity (Pol): Negative (Neg), positive (Pos), neutral (Neu), and negative-positive (Neg-pos). Bednarek (2008) draws attention to the fact that the polarity of a word is not always evident. In ambiguous cases, the corpus itself served as the “adjudicator” displaying all collocations with the keyword in question, thus allowing an overview of its tendency towards the negative or positive.        Table 1: Keywords and token number4.1 Sarcasm versus ironyThe nouns sarcasm and irony yielded 309 and 498 tokens, respectively. The focus was on what adjectives and verbs appeared in the surrounding of the core word. Sarcasm is generally thought of as the more insulting of the two notions, for which verification was sought in the specific adjectives collocating with it. Adjectives appearing in positions 1L and 2L were recorded. It was necessary to consider the second word on the left (2L) too in order to be able to include modified adjectives (e.g. thinly veiled sarcasm) and when there were two adjectives (e.g. nifty, little irony). The two expectations were as follows: i) sarcasm would, in general, enter into fewer adjective collocations compared to irony; and ii) when sarcasm does collocate with adjectives, it collocates more with negative adjectives compared to irony. These expectations were indeed met (see Table 2). A possible explanation could be the restrictiveness of sarcasm and the permissiveness of irony as well as what we know about their etymology (see section 2). As has been mentioned earlier, there are forms of irony not related to language, such as situational irony (Lucariello, 1994) and dramatic irony (Muecke, 1970). A search for the word irony would inevitably reveal the explicit uses, that is forms that imply other than verbal irony. The adjective collocating with irony may possibly reveal what kind of irony we are dealing with (examples from the corpus include cosmic irony, tragic irony, and poetic irony). Since there is a much wider range of possibilities to talk about irony than sarcasm, the occurrence of a much wider range of adjectives is justified. In contrast, sarcasm only exists in the verbal realm; therefore, a search would have to refer to usage necessarily related to language (examples from the corpus include biting sarcasm, bitter sarcasm, and judgmental sarcasm). In terms of their etymology,Table 2: Adjective collocations     Adjective collocations     Pol   Sarcasm     T ok en s  Irony    T ok en s   Negbiting, rude, bitter, cheap, judgmen tal, thinly veiled  6cruel (3), cruelest, horrible (3), terrible, awful, thudding, twisted (2), nasty spiteful, malicious, stupefying, humorless, sick (2), plain old, crazy, heavy, sad (3), tragic (2)  17    Pos -    - delightful, delicious (3), glorious, lovely, lovely little, nifty little, nice (2),perfect,beautifulincredible (2), crowning, grand, great (2), greatestpoetic, (3),   15    Neu -    - real (5), final (2), huge, obvious, ultimate (2), unexpected, cosmic   7    Neg -pos -    - supreme sucky   1          6    40

The construction adj+sarcasm appeared merely 6 times in the corpus which is 85% less than the construction adj+irony. In light of the data, the second expectation (when sarcasm does collocate with adjectives, it collocates more with negative adjectives compared to irony) turns out to be an understatement; not only does sarcasm collocate more with negative adjectives than irony, but, in fact, it only collocates with negative adjectives. The lack of both positive and neutral adjective collocations could, in theory, be explained by the differing number of tokens in the corpus; however, intuitively the difference does not seem big enough for this discrepancy. It is more plausible that sarcasm is a much more content laden word than irony which obviates its “taking” a range of different adjectives. In the same spirit, irony seems not to carry this unambiguous import and can accommodate a fairly wide range of adjectives. This is also indicative of the polarity of the words; namely that whereas sarcasm connotes negativity (being faithful to its original sense), irony per se is a neutral term acquiring a specific meaning and polarity only when attached to a particular adjective. Note that even then it can maintain its neutral sense (e.g. real irony, ultimate irony, etc.).Verbs appearing in the core words’ neighborhood in the range of 1L-4L were considered too. It was deemed necessary to provide this range so that phrasal verbs followed by a preposition could also be included (e.g. get rid of the sarcasm). Table 3 summarizes the findings providing the verb collocations with information on their type based on Quirk et al. (1985). Overlapping verb uses are boldfaced.* they take the article the.Table 3: Verb collocationsNotable observations are the following: Among activity verbs that collocate with sarcasm there is a prevalence of imperative forms with synonymous meanings to which, in the irony column, only one verb corresponds (i.e. lose). The same set of imperative forms in the sarcasm column is responsible for the dominance of negative polarity which once again is not present with irony. No imperative form actually encourages the other person to employ sarcasm or irony instead they actively discourage it by giving order to stop (e.g.     Verb collocations   Verb type       Sarcasm      Irony    dynamic verbs    activity verbs   save*, can*, cut*, cut off*, stop*, skip*, turn down*, drop*, kill*, lay   lose*, comment on, talk about, teach, laugh at, state, go for*,

The overarching use of metaphorical imperative forms is striking and awaits future study. Collocations with irony mostly have to do with speaking (e.g. mention, comment on, state, etc.). At the same time, both irony and sarcasm can both be enjoyed and disliked as the box of verbs of perception and cognition shows. Interestingly, the same box contains verbs that, upon checking the context, turn out to be in 1st person singular, whereas this exclusivity is not characteristic of the other categories. Conversely, our sentiments about sarcasm and irony and how we experience them tend to be self-oriented. Furthermore, verbs with sarcasm have more to do with emotions; whereas verbs with irony, even though having overlaps with sarcasm, are of a wider range (e.g. consider, believe, get, etc.). Overall, based on the verb distribution, sarcasm seems to be the less favorable notion.4.2 Sarcastic versus ironicThe adjectives sarcastic and ironic yielded 247 and 938 tokens, respectively. One token was removed from the ironic category due to it being a fragment the meaning of which could not be deciphered. Consequently, the token number changed to 937. Firstly, the noun collocations were scrutinized. The occurrences are collected in Table 4 where they are divided into animate and inanimate nouns. Numbers in parentheses show how many times the collocation occurred if it is more than one. Overlapping items have been boldfaced. Classification within the boxes (separated by a blank space) was done according to semantic subsets, in an admittedly flexible way. Bednarek (2008) points out the arbitrariness involved in assigning labels to disparate semantic categories. For this reason, labelling was omitted altogether in Table 4 and was handled flexibly in Table 5. General comments on Table 4 will, however, make use of certain common headings for the sake of clarity.Table 4: Noun collocationsA rather conspicuous lack of animate nouns is noticeable in the ironic column, although it is feasible to designate humans as ironic. This lack
 might simply be accidental, especially because a closer analysis of the corpus reveals that ironic can indeed be used as a human depicter, exemplified in (1) where the relevant parts are boldfaced.(1) Maybe I was just giving vent to all the horrible things that people have been saying about me and I was being ironic.The occurrence of sarcastic with animate nouns tells us the following: i) being sarcastic is a human property (even though the metaphorical uses, such as little bug might suggest differently at first sight), ii) its semantic preference extends to family relations apart from general references to a person, iii) and it works with metaphorical designations of a person. With regard to the inanimate columns, a comparison is possible between noun collocations with sarcastic and ironic. Both sarcastic and ironic appear adjacent to language-related words (e.g. comment, reference, prose, advice, etc.). The prevalence of paralinguistic signals (e.g. slow clap of approval, chuckle, tone, etc.) with sarcastic is worth mentioning. Collocations with ironic referring to aspects of life (e.g. twists of fate, circumstance, etc.) cannot be found with sarcastic. Personality traits (e.g. sense of humor) and deeds (e.g. snide act) may be sarcastic, whereas abstract concepts (e.g. time) along with objects (e.g. jelly bracelets) may be ironic. Nouns in the sarcastic column promote categorization in a more straightforward manner than nouns in the ironic column due to the more clear-cut semantic subsets. Table 5 illustrates a different angle where classification is done based on the identity of the referent whether it is human (H) or non-human (NH), regardless of collocational behavior. The non-human category for sarcastic is further narrowed down into linguistic (L) (comment, remark, etc.), paralinguistic (P) (laughter, applause, etc.), and other instances (O) (personality trait, deed, etc.); and for ironic, life (LIFE) (situation, turn of events, etc.), linguistic (L), paralinguistic (P), and other instances (O) (object, concept, etc.). Here, linguistic implies anything uttered via words,whereas paralinguistic implies anything conveyed via other means than words which can range from body language and facial gestures to tone and pitch.    Identity of referent              sarcastic   ironic  H NH     H   NH   L       P      O     LIFE   L     P     O   T o t a l       18  29    21    9     7  884  33   1   1   247   937  Table 5: Identity of referentThere are some remarkable differences between the numbers. It is immediately noticeable that the referent of ironic can indeed be a human even though no noun collocation was found in the corpus to support this. Nevertheless, it is more frequent to refer to a human as being sarcastic. A further remark on intentionality is worthwhile. As far as pragmatics is concerned, there is an underlying assumption that sarcasm differs from irony in terms of the former being possible only by intention (Camp, 2012; Sanders, 2013), whereas the latter happening unintentionally from time to time. Evidence for unintentionality would manifest if someone other than the speaker would question if the speaker was being ironic, for instance. The corpus results do not display examples of this sort; instead human referents are ironic in an either self- proclaimed fashion, such as in example (1), or they are declared thus by someone else as shown in example (2) where the relevant parts are boldfaced.(2) A: And wanting to do this for the money -- heavens. That's the furthest thing from my mind. B: I'll bet you were just being ironic again.
 The most striking difference is doubtless the inclusion of a separate category in the non-human ironic column, namely that of life. It is a deliberately vague term that comprises all kinds of expressions that relate to some aspect of this abstract concept. Once again we see how only ironic may be used in reference to life but not sarcastic. Furthermore, ironic seems to be predominantly used in life-related phrases and significantly less in linguistic, paralinguistic, and other types. In sum, it can be said that sarcastic tends to be associated with the description of people, whereas ironic is reserved for the description of aspects of life.Finally, Table 6 gives an overview of the adverbs collocating with sarcastic and ironic divided into types of adverbs. Numbers in parentheses show how many times the collocation occurred if it is more than one. Overlapping adverb uses are boldfaced.meaning that scaling upwards from an assumed norm (Quirk et al., 1985) is more common, and it is more common with ironic.4.3 Sarcastically versus ironicallyThe adverbs sarcastically and ironically yielded 191 and 82 tokens, respectively. In the case of ironically, 3 tokens were duplicates and were thus discarded. As a result, the token number changed to 79. Examples in Table 7 were grouped according to their being representative of linguistic (L) or paralinguistic (P) usage. Linguistic use was further divided into groups where the adverb referred to the utterance (U) or to a situation (S). The word situation is meant in a general sense; synonyms would include turn of event and happening. Striking differences are observable between the behavior of sarcastically and ironically in both linguistic as well as paralinguistic terms.     Adverb collocations    type of adverb     sarcastic     ironic    amplifier very (3) unbelievably, sadly, cruelly, incredibly, certainly, particularly (2), wonderfully (2), perfectly (2), eerily (2), totally (2), very (11), really (13)    downtoner   pretty    pretty (2), quite (3)        Adverbial behavior     sarcastically  ironically     L     P  L    P      U     S187     U   S   1   T o t a l    4      0       2     76  191   79Table 6: Adverb collocationsWhat stands out clearly is the prevalence of the adv+ironic construction. The content laden nature of sarcasm has been touched upon before (see section 4.1), and it seems to be confirmed in its adverbial form as well. Referring to (usually) someone as sarcastic is apparently sufficient to convey the speaker’s attitude; whereas the equivocality of irony warrants the use of a much wider range of adverbs. Amplifiers are in a more privileged position compared to downtoners,Table 7: Adverbial behaviorWhat can be asserted in general based on these numbers is that neither adverb is particularly prominent in referring to the utterance even though it is possible to do so, which apparently happens in cases where the irony or sarcasm has not been recognized or there is a chance their not being recognized by the listener; therefore, the speaker feels the need to let them know how they meant what they said. Examples (3) and (4) are representative of these cases. Relevant parts are boldfaced.
 (3) A: Oh, boy, am I going to have fun with this one.B: What do you mean, fun?A: I just -- I meant it sarcastically.(4) Well, I guess I didn't describe him too accurately -- she said ironically.As for depicting a situation, ironically seems to be the only available option. Sarcastically is not used even once, which is suggestive of the fact that perhaps it is not an adequate word for describing a situation. This tendency would very much fall in line with what previous research holds about irony and sarcasm. Namely, that whereas irony may work both verbally and in describing situations, sarcasm is confined to the verbal realm, be it linguistic or paralinguistic in nature. Example (5) shows how ironically is normally used to describe an event. It is easy to see that substituting sarcastically here would result in infelicity.(5) But then, ironically, um... when you're about to lose someone you really love... you realize how precious they are to you.At last, in terms of paralinguistic signals, sarcastically well outnumbers ironically; however, the one instance in which ironically can also be used indicates that it is not impossible for the latter to be used in such context. Example (6) shows the one instance of such use in the corpus with relevant parts boldfaced.1In contrast, the ironic tone does not manifest in the corpus which mirrors what some previous studies say about the non-existence of it (e.g. Attardo et al., 2003). This implies that one significant distinguishing factor between irony and sarcasm is that only the latter has a concomitant tone. Choosing to convey a message sarcastically is a personal choice which also entails harsh criticism towards someone (invariably a human) and thus has to be necessarily closely associated with the person “performing the sarcastic act”, whereas ironically as a depicter of a situation seems to highlight some universal phenomenon that would arguably be perceived similarly by all human beings. Not to mention the fact that recognizing irony in a situation may not imply a critical attitude towards the situation itself.5 ConclusionThe focus in this article was on the collocational characteristics of explicit sarcasm and irony and its variants. The two terms are closely-related; however, are not synonymous which idea is in contrast with how the literature usually treats them. It was hypothesized that explicit uses of sarcasm and irony (and their lemmas) would shed light on their distinguishing features. Certain findings support previous literature, while others add new information. The overall conclusion is that irony and its lemmas as well as sarcasm and its lemmas, respectively, represent similar behavior in the corpus. The most important observations are the following: i) sarcasm is a more content laden concept with a default negative polarity which obviates its taking a wide range of adjectives, while irony is a more neutral term and thus needs an adjective to determine its polarity, ii) sarcastic attracts verbs in the imperative mood, iii) the sentiments and emotions for both irony and sarcasm are self-oriented, iv) the ironic+animate N construction does not occur, v) ironic has a tendency to refer to aspects of life, while sarcastic has a tendency to refer to paralinguistic signals and people, and vi) ironically is used to depict situations, while(6)I thought you were trying to protect me. Not some filthy affair. [Laughs ironically].There is mention of a certain sarcastic tone in the literature (Haiman, 1997; Creusere, 1999; Woodland and Voyer, 2011), which is supported by the corpus examples the majority of which do indeed refer to tone. Example (7) demonstrates this tendency with the relevant part boldfaced.(7) [Sarcastically] You're real concerned about your mom, huh?1 It is noteworthy that the example may not be the most accurate use of ironically modifying laugh. 
 sarcastically is used to refer to paralinguistic signals, especially one’s tone. The explicit manifestations of sarcasm and irony indicate that the former is being more human-oriented, while the latter is more situation-oriented. These findings carry promise for further research.AcknowledgmentsDo not number the acknowledgment section.
