the Application of HNC Context Framework in Sentimental Orientation AnalysisAbstract: The paper, based on the current sentimental dictionaries and HNC contextual framework, puts forward a method of text sentimental orientation analysis. The sentimental analysis process covers two phases: feature words matching and feature sentence (or sentence group) finding; feature sentence or sentence group sentimental analysis based on HNC contextual framework. In the first phase, sentimental dictionary of HowNet and Valency Dictionary of English Adjective (VDEA) are applied while the feature sentence or sentence group are analyzed in the second phase. The method, through exact matching of feature words, makes the posterior processing work more effective energy-focused because only those sentences or sentence groups containing subjective sentiment can be analyzed and processed. This thought also illustrates one of the spirits of HNC: doing certain things and refraining from doing other things.Key words: Sentimental dictionary; HNC; contextual framework; sentimental orientation analysis 1 ForwardWith the development of internet, everyday we will unavoidably come across large quantity of information including texts, pictures and videos etc among which text plays the most crucial role in transmitting information. Therefore, currently the research of text classification, information retrieval, and information filtering are becoming more and more important in the NLP field[1]. The text sentimental orientation analysis is drawing more and more focus in the past few years and has became one of the most active part of NLP research. Nowadays the methods of studying text sentimental analysis includes two types: machine learning based and semantic analysis based methods.The method based on semantic analysis now mainly takes various kinds of basic sentimental dictionary resources. Also, in the process of analysis, the method takes syntactic analysis into consideration. There are more and more researchers in China focus on the sentimental analysis research. Liu Qun[2] puts forwards a kind of lexical semantic similarity calculation method based on HowNet knowledge base. He tries to get lexical similarity through calculating the similarity of sememes, which greatly improved the calculation precision rate. Xiong Delan[3] also take HowNet as his basic semantic knowledge base to calculate lexical similarity, and furthermore he put forward a method of calculating sentence sentimental orientation based on calculating the semantic distance and grammar distance.Zhu Yanlan[4] put forward a kind of method of calculating lexical sentimental orientation through calculating the semantic similarity and semantic field base on HowNet. Yu Xiao[5], base on various sentimental dictionaries to calculate different sentimental value, and furthermore applies accumulating these “weights” to get the ultimate text sentimental orientation value of WeiBo texts. Wang Lancheng[6] applies sentimental ontological knowledge bases to extract feature words and calculates their sentimental orientation, and furthermore takes syntactic analysis into consideration to get the ultimate text sentimental orientation. Dong Lili[7] also puts forward a method of analyzing commercial goods evaluations base on some sentimental dictionaries and domain ontological resources.With the appearance of HNC (hierarchical network of concept) which firstly put forward by Mr. Huang Zengyang in Institute of Acoustics Chinese Acadimy of Sciences, more and more researchers tries to apply HNC theories to semantic and sentimental analysis. Jin Yaohong[8-10], based on context
frameworks of HNC, designed a method of calculating text similarity. Wei Xiangfeng[11] classified words that exert effects upon sentimental analysis into four types: objective words, appraisal words, logical words and degree words. Based on the above study, he constructed binary model and triplet model to calculate sentence sentimental orientation, and furthermore calculate sentence and text sentimental orientation through calculating semantic chunks(the concept put forward in HNC theory). Jing Zhanghua[12], based on context framework, applies domains, situations and backgrounds of texts to calculate text sentimental orientation analysis. Zhang Lu[13] applies context framework to calculate sentence similarity. Zhang Keliang[14] also pay attention upon the importance of context framework of HNC theory in analyzing semantic disambiguation. Tang Xingquan[15] gives us a thorough introduction of counter sexy knowledge base based on HNC theory and relative application of the base. Liu Weinan[16] applies HNC theory to analyze sentimental orientation of comments on e-shops. He Zongfan[17] and Yang Tianming[18] both apply HNC theory to design the similarity calculation methods. The studies concerning HNC theory is active and have bright application perspective in NLP field.1 basic sentimental dictionary resources and HNC context frameworkCurrently, domestic sentimental dictionaries are rapidly developed, and most used sentimentalresources include sentimental dictionary distributed in HowNet and National TaiWan Universitysentiment Dictionary (or NTUSD). The former includes 4366 commendatory words and 4370 derogatory words while the later dictionary includes 2810 commendatory words and 8272 derogatory words. This paper takes the sentimental dictionary of HowNet and VDEA (Valency Dictionary of English Adjective) constructed by the author of the paper as the basic resources to carry out sentimental orientation analysis.Before inducing HNC theory itself, the relationships among concept, symbol and referent are represented as follows: 概念CONCEPT     符号SYMBOL  Fig1: the relationships of concept, symbol and thingThe above figure gives us a clear explanation of the relationships. HNC theory mainly describesthe knowledge representation in the conceptual space, and it applies formalization method to represent the relationship between the superficial structure and semantic relation. HNC is a kind of theory focus on understanding the concepts of the language world from four levels: concept, sentential category, context unit and context framework[8-10]. The formula of representations are as follows:CASE:=CP(ICP1,BCP2;ICP2,BCP2;...) HNC1ICP∽m//n,ekm//ekn,cmn//dmn,-0BCP∽t=x,\k=x,i=3//7CP represents concept primitives, ICP represents intermediary concept primitives, the figurerepresents levels, BCP represents bottom concept primitive.

Therefore, take context factors into consideration in the process of semantic or sentimental analysis is very crucial. HNC context framework covers various conceptual knowledge and it describes context information from three levels which makes a perfect merge for macro context and micro context.2 Text sentimental orientation analysis based on sentimental dictionary and HNC context frameworkText sentimental orientation greatly depends on the sentimental polarity of feature words such as nouns, verbs and adjectives. The paper put forward two-step sentimental analysis method: firstly applying HowNet and VDEA dictionary to extract feature words; then applying HNC context framework to analyze sentence and sentence group that contains feature words. By this way, the “language noise” in the process of sentimental analysis can be removed, which will surely improve the efficiency of the calculation. And the detailed calculation procedure is as follows:HNC3-1 HNC3-2HNC4

The total number is 17887, and the detailed information is as follows:Tab1: sentimental word sets of HowNet TYPE NUMBER EXAMPLE      1 (CH)positive sentimental words 8362 (CH)positive evaluation words 3730爱不忍释 爱不释手 蔼蔼 蔼然 蔼然可亲哀怜 哀悯 哀戚      3 (CH)negative sentimental words1 http://www.keenage.com/html/c_bulletin_2007.htm1254

The detailed information is as follows:Fig3: adjective valence information table2.1.2 lexical similarity calculationLiu Qun[2] applies HowNet to calculate word similarity. In his method he treats the calculation of two separate words as the calculation of two concepts2. For example, W1 and W2 are two separate words and the similarity of the two words can be got by calculating their various senses contained by each word, and furthermore the ultimate similarity value is the maximum value of the similarity of different senses of two words. The formula is as follows:Sim(W1, W2) = Max Sim(S1i, S2j) (i∈[1,n], j∈[1,m])Each sense of a word covers different sememes which covers four components: independentsememe, other sememe, relation sememe and symbol sememe. In the process of calculation, the above four factors must be taken into consideration, and the sememe similarity calculation method is as follows:Sim(P1, P2) = A/(D + A)啰唆 啰嗦 噲 百分之百 倍加 备至触目 耳闻feel findadopt adoption adoration abstruse abundant abundantlyaccuse abuse accusation abandon abandoned aberrant                        absolutely alarmingly     2 http://hownet.kooge.com/hownet/smartfinder/index.jsp?hsign=6
P1 and P2 is separate sememes, and A represents the path length at the sememe level; D is adjustable paremeter and the suitable value is set as 7 after testing different values. And the ultimate similarity calculation formula is as follows:Sim S1, S2 = 4i−1 βi ij−1 Simj(S1, S2)In the formula, βi(1≤i≤4) is adjustable parameter and the following two conditions are satisfied: β1+β2+β3+β4=1,β1≥β2≥β3≥β4。Sim1(S1,S2)、Sim2(S1,S2)、Sim3(S1,S2) and Sim4(S1,S2) represents four different components。Different from HowNet, VDEA dictionary has its special structure. The paper, according to the characteristics of dictionary, adopts different processing methods: applying HowNet as basic resources to process verbs, nouns and advers while applying adjective resources of both dictionaries to analyze adjectives.2.1.3 The recognition and confirmation of feature wordsThe paper adopts lexical similarity calculation method as the tool to make comparative suits between verbs, nouns and adjectives in the testing texts with dictionaries. In this process, VDEA dictionary is applied to give adjectives a clear analysis.After identifying the feature words, feature sentences will be extracted by the standard that normally the sentences containing feature words are feature sentences. Also, some special symbolssuch2.2 2.2.1“!”and ”?” are applied in judging feature sentences.Sentence and sentence group processing based on HNC context framework The components of HNC context framework(1) Domain. Domain depicts the properties of different objectives. HNC covers 11 different domains, and furthermore more detailed classification also given. The total number of domain classification is 300. The follow figure is about the hierarchical classification structure of politic domain:Special activity (a)politics(a1)Political fight (a13)Fig4: HNC conceptual tree(2) Situation. Situation framework describes the relationships between objectives and contents,and obtains situation framework through domain and sentence category knowledge. According to domain set, we can easily get different domain sentence categories and furthermore various relevant HNC symbols and argument roles can to filled into the framework. The main components of it covers A (actor), B (objective),C (event) and E (act).                 Forms of political fight (a133\k) Fight of union and independence (a133(e2n,e2m) )              
(3) Background. Background framework mainly describes time, space and authors’ standpoint and sentimental orientation.2.2.2 Similarity calculation based on context frameworkAfter confirmation of sentences and sentence groups containing feature words, we will put these feature sentences into HNC context framework to analyze their sentimental orientation. The paper adopts the method put forward by Jin Yaohong[10] and Tan Zhanghua[12]: the context similarity calculation means the calculation of the similarity of their different components:Sim_S1_S2:A ∗ SimDom S1. Domain, S2. Domain + b ∗ SimSit S1. Situation, S2. Situation + c ∗SimBac S1.Background,S2.BackgroundS1 represents context framework, a/b/c are adjustable parameters, and the context similarity calculation depends on the similarity of domain, similarity of situation and similarity of background. The detailed calculation is as follows:(1) domain similarity: SimDom(S1.D,S2.D)=0 For each S2.Di in S2 For each S1.Dj in S1If (S2.Di==S1.Dj)If (S2.Di∈S1.Dj)If (S2.Di>S1.Dj)(2) situation similarity:SubSim=2; SubSim=1; SimDom = SubSim;SimSit ST1,ST2 :SimSubj(ST1.subj,ST2.subj)∗ SimObj(ST1.obj,ST2.obj) ∗ SimAct(ST1.act,ST2.act)The subject and object of situation are represented by A, and the similarity calculation is as follows:If A1≌A2If A1∽A2If A1∈A2(3) background similarity:SimSit(A1,A2)=2; SimSit(A1,A2)=2; SimSit(A1,A2)=2;SimBac BK1, BK2 :a ∗ SimBac(BK1. time, BK2. time) + b ∗ SimBac(BK1. space, BK2. space) + c ∗ SimBac(BK1. O. polarity, BK2. O. polarity) ∗ ... ∗ SimBac(BK1. On. polarity, BK2. On. polarity)a/b/c are adjustable parameters and O represents objective.2.3 Experiment and result analysisIn order to test the similarity calculation method, the author collects 300 texts from internet which covers different domains such politics, sports, economy and film commentary text etc. In the process of selecting texts, both individual subjective judgment and statistical method are applied: firstly selecting some texts according to personal judgment, and then makes a statistical analysis upon these texts by considering the degree of focus on the internet. The detailed text set is as follows:Tab2: testing text sets from websitesWebsite Paper numberWebBBC50Sina 50 And VOA 50 Sohu 50            Website Paper number           
  number Taobao 50 Rottentomatoes 50Based on the above texts, first the author gives them a primitive classification according to personal judgment. And then the sentimental orientation method put forward in the paper is applied to get another classification result. A comparative analysis is carried out between the two results, and based on that the ultimate experimental result can be got. The paper adopts precision rate to evaluate the results, and the formula is as follows:Precision  right sentimental recognition number 100% text numberIn the process of experiment, the parameter a,b and c are set as 1/3, 1/3 and 1/3. The detailed result is as follows:             politicsTab3: experimental resultsRecognition precision rate86.5%   good comments 95%Film comments 94.5sports 91%From the results we can find that the recognition precision rates of politics and sports are relatively lower than those of good comments and film comments. Because the words used in political texts usually are implicit and the words with apparent sentiment are seldom used, which makes sentimental orientation analysis a little more difficult. By contrast, the users’ comments upon films and commercial goods on the internet are often filled with personal emotions or sentimental orientation, which is the direct cause of the higher recognition precision rate in the experiment.3 ConclusionThe paper put forward a method of text sentimental orientation analysis based sentimental dictionaries and HNC context framework. The this method, text sentimental analysis covers two phases: recognition and confirmation of feature words, sentences and sentence groups; sentimental orientation analysis of feature sentences and sentence groups based on HNC context framework. HowNet sentimental dictionary and VDEA are applied in the first phase while the second phase is carried out in HNC context framework. This method takes sentimental resources as basic uphold, and take natural language understanding and processing method of HNC as basic means, which perfectly merges the advantages of both basic semantic resources and HNC theory and give the problem of sentimental orientation analysis a new way.Context is the most important factor in the process of sentimental analysis. No precise understanding can be got without fully considering the effects of context or background. The context framework theory of HNC therefore plays crucial role in solving the drawback of semantic analysis. HNC process the problem of context from three different levels: domain, situation and background, which almost cover all factors of context and surely develops its unique way of semantic or sentimental processing.References
