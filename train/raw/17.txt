On the polysemy of the Japanese discourse particle ne: A study with special reference to intonationAbstractThis work aims to provide an adequate description/analysis of the functions the Japanese discourse particle ne occurring at the end of a declarative clause, paying special at- tention to how they are affected/constrainted by intonation. The two central functions of ne, the ⟨call for confirmation⟩ use and the ⟨shared information⟩ use, are associated with distinct sets of intonations. The former is al- ways accompanied by the question-rise con- tour. The latter, on the other hand, may be accompanied by the insisting-rise contour or the rise-fall contour; the choice of the rise-fall contour conveys an emotional tone, while the choice of the insisting-rise contour does not have this effect. Ne with the question-rise con- tour has two other uses, which we label the ⟨call for approval⟩ and ⟨offer/promise⟩ uses. Ne with the insisting-rise or rise-fall contour too has multiple other uses, which we tenta- tively classify into two types: the ⟨look-up⟩ and ⟨dismissive reaction⟩ uses. Descriptions of the total of six uses are provided, and the conceptual links between them are discussed.1 IntroductionIt has been acknowledged in the literature: (i) that ne, one of the most frequently occurring discourse particles in Japanese, has varied functions, and (ii) that the interpretation of ne is constrained by into- nation (e.g., Hashimoto 1992; Koyama 1997; Sugito 1997; Moriyama 2001; Miyazaki et al. 2002). A full description of its diverse functions and correla- tion with intonation, however, is yet to be developed.This paper aims to provide an adequate classification and analysis of the functions of ne occurring at the end of a declarative clause.In Section 2, as a preliminary, we illustrate the in- ventory of intonation contours in standard Japanese, which comprises four contour types (question rise, insisting rise, flat, and rise-fall). In Sections 3 and 4, two functions of ne which have often been regarded as central in the literature are examined. The first is the ⟨call for confirmation⟩ use, which is associ- ated with the question-rise contour. The second is the ⟨shared information⟩ use, which may be accom- panied by the insisting-rise or rise-fall contour; the choice of the rise-fall contour conveys an additional emotive tone, while the choice of the insisting-rise contour lacks this effect.Section 5 discusses two other uses of ne with the question rise, which we call the ⟨call for approval⟩ and ⟨offer/promise⟩ uses. Section 6 dis- cusses instances of ne that are accompanied by the insisting-rise or rise-fall contour but have rather dif- ferent semantic contribution than ne in its ⟨shared information⟩ use; we propose to classify such usage into two types: ⟨look-up⟩ and ⟨dismissive reaction⟩. Section 7 briefly discusses the conceptual links be- tween the different uses of ne.It is worth noting that the semantic and intona- tional properties of ne to be discussed are largely shared by another particle na. It is beyond the scope of the current work, however, to examine in exactly what ways the two particles contrast with each other.As stated above, this work focuses on ne occur- ring at the end of a declarative clause.

rogatives with the question marker ka and/or a wh- phrase (as in (2)), directives (as in (3)), or sentence fragments (as in (4)), is excluded from considera- tion (see Hashimoto 1992: 92 and Nihongo Kijutsu Bunpoo Kenkyuukai 2003: 255 for some discussion of ne in such environments; what the arrow symbols refer to will be explained presently).1(1) Anohito-wa-ne(e)↑↓hontoo-nitour (Venditti’s “HL%”). Throughout the paper, we use the arrow symbols ↗, ↑, ↘ and ↑↓ to repre- sent the question-rise, insisting-rise, flat and rise-fall contours, respectively (a similar notational conven- tion is used in Kori 1997).2 Also, shorthand like “ne↑” will be used to represent “ne accompanied by the insisting-rise contour”, etc.The question-rise contour is more concave (scooped) than the insisting rise contour. The question-rise contour is typically (though not al- ways) used in questions, as in (5a). The insisting- rise contour, exemplified in (5b), adds an emotive and childish tone to the utterance when it occurs on a bare declarative.3 The flat contour, exemplified in (5c), is the unmarked intonation for declaratives.(2) a.Kimi-mo kuru-ka-ne↗ you-also come.Prs-Q-ne ‘Are you coming too?’(3) a.Kutsu-o nuide-{ne↗/ne↑} shoe-Acc take.off.Ger-ne ‘Take off your shoes.’that person-Th-ne sugoi-yo.reallyamazing.Prs-DP‘That person is, well, really amazing.’b.

The rise-fall contour is not used on a root declarative without a discourse particle, so that Mieru↑↓ sounds unnatural as an independent ut- terance. The rise-fall contour may occur sentence- medially, however, indicating that the utterance has not yet finished, as in (6).4(6) Mieru(u)↑↓ toki-mo(o)↑↓ atta↘see.Pot.Prs time-also exist.Pst‘There were also, um, times when, um, (we) could see (it).’The particle ne can be accompanied by any of the four contours, although the combination of ne and2↗ and ↘ are also used to represent the rising and falling intonations in English, without assuming that they are phoneti- cally identical or similar to the question-rise and flat intonations in Japanese.3Utterances ending with ne↑ or yone↑, however, do not nec- essarily convey an emotive or childish tone.4The rise-fall contour is also used on a sentence fragment, as in Hayaku↑↓ ‘Do it already!’ (lit. ‘Fast.’).

In the following, we will not include ne↘ in the data, assuming that it is functionally more or less equivalent to ne↑↓.

An important question regarding the discourse function of ne in its CFC use is how S (the speaker) makes a choice bween it and the com- plex particle yone, which likewise can be used to ask for confirmation when accompanied by the rise-fall contour.    mi eru         Time (s)    mie ru         00.5009Time (s)    mie ru         00.3801Time (s)   mi  eru     (10) a.Kinoo, Tozai Hoteru-ni yesterday T. hotel-Dat ikaremashita-yone↑↓ go.Pst.Hon.Plt-yone    00.6807Time (s) Figure 1:“Mieru↘”, and “Mieru↑↓ . . .” (Oshima 2014: 444)Actualtokens of“Mieru↗”, “Mieru↑”,5Taken from the novel Iesu Kirisuto no Nazo by Sakae Saito, published by Kobunsha in 1995.6Taken from the novel Kakei Toshi by Soji Shimada, pub- lished by Kodansha in 1986.Pitch (Hz) Pitch (Hz) Pitch (Hz) Pitch (Hz)

We cannot give full justice to the relevant conditions here; to mention just one such condition, while an utterance of the form (11a) can be used to ask for confirmation or clarification about the con- tent of what H (the hearer) has just said, a similar utterance with yone (i.e., (11b)) cannot be so used.(11) a. {[a clause headed by a nominal predi- cate]/[a clause ending with the discourse auxiliary noda or the discourse particle no]} + ne↗b. {[a clause headed by a nominal predi- cate]/[a clause ending with the discourse auxiliary noda or the discourse particle no]} + yone↑↓    mi e  rune         Time (s)     mi e rune         00.53Time (s)    mi  e rune (12) A:Ashita-wa Maeda-san-ga tomorrow-Th M.-Suffix-Nom kimasu.come.Prs.Plt        00.6831‘Maeda will come tomorrow.’B: Maeda-san desu-{ne↗/#yone↑↓} M.-Suffix Cop.Prs.Plt-{ne/yone}‘It is Maeda (who will come, I got it).’ B’: Maeda-san-gaM.-Suffix-Nom kuru-{ndesu/no}-{ne↗/#yone↑↓}come.Prs-{noda.Prs.Plt/no}-{ne/yone}‘Maeda will come(, I got it).’ B”: Maeda-san-gaM.-Suffix-Nom kimasu-{#ne↗/#yone↑↓} come.Prs.Plt-{ne/yone}(adapted from Oshima 2014: 447)Time (s)Figure 2: Actual tokens of “Mieru-ne↗”, “Mieru-ne↑”, and “Mieru-ne↑↓ . . .”Pitch (Hz) Pitch (Hz) Pitch (Hz)
4 The ⟨Shared Information⟩ UseNe accompanied by the insisting-rise contour (ne↑) is commonly used to convey – or conventionally im- plicate – that S assumes that H has been aware that the propositional content of the utterance holds. The semantic effect of ne in this use, which we refer to as the ⟨shared information⟩ (SI) use, is comparable to that of the English reversed polarity tag interrogative with the falling intonation.7(13) (S and H are graduate students of the same de- partment.)Iwata-sensei, kinoo-no konshinkai-no I.-professor yesterday-Gen party-Gen toki, nanka fukigen datta-ne↑time somehow sullen Cop.Pst-ne‘Prof. Iwata was kind of sullen at the party yes- terday, wasn’t he↘’(14) (a man to his girlfriend waiting for the bus to- gether in cold)Samui-ne↑ cold.Prs-ne‘It’s cold, isn’t it↘’(15) (to the opponent of a chess game)O-tsuyoi-desu-ne↑ Hon-strong.Prs-PltAux.Prs-ne ‘You’re good.’(16) (a conversation between two students)A: Raishuu-wa shiken-ka.next.week-Th exam-Q‘(I have just recalled that) the exam is next week.’B: Iya-da-ne↑ annoying-Cop.Prs-ne ‘It’s annoying, isn’t it↘’As is the case with the CFC use, it is a rather com- plicated matter how ne in its SI use “divides the la- bor” with yone (Oshima 2014). It is possible, for instance, to replace ne↑ in (13) with yone↑, with- out causing a substantial change in the pragmatic, let alone truth-conditional, meaning.7The SI use in the current work subsumes what Miyazaki et al. (2002: 279) call the “dooi yookyuu (call for agreement)” and “dooi hyoomei (expression of agreement)” uses.(17) Iwata-sensei, kinoo-no konshinkai-no I.-professor yesterday-Gen party-Gen toki, nanka fukigen datta-yone↑time somehow sullen Cop.Pst-yone ‘idem’The primary factor that conditions the choice be- tween ne and yone in their SI use is whether the propositional content is information (belief) that S acquired in the discourse situation, or in other words, what called Akatsuka (1985) calls “newly- learned information” for S. When this discourse condition holds, the choice of ne is compulsory and the use of yone is blocked.(18) (S and H have been working in a room without a window. Coming out of the room, they see that, to their surprise, it is raining.)A, ame-ga futte ru-{a. ne↑/b. #yone↑} oh rain-Nom fall.Ger IpfvAux.Prs-ne/yone ‘Oh, it is raining.’(19) (S was invited to H’s home for the first time. Looking out on the garden, S notices that there is a pine tree.)Matsu-no ki-gapine-Gen tree-Nomarimasu-{a. ne↑/b. #yone↑}exist.Prs.Plt-textitne/yone ‘You have a pine tree.’It is possible to use ne↑↓ to convey a meaning sim- ilar to that of ne↑ in its SI use. Ne↑↓ additionally indicates that S has a strong emotion (e.g., surprise, joy, discontent) toward the propositional content. To illustrate, the (b) versions of (20A,B) carry an emo- tive tone, which the (a) versions lack.(20) (on a busy street; to a friend walking together)A: Kyoo-wahito-ga today-Th people-Nom ooi-{a. ne↑/b. ne(e)↑↓}many.Prs-ne‘There are a lot of people today, aren’t there↘’B: Soo-da-{a. ne↑/b. ne(e)↑↓} so-Cop.Prs‘There are, indeed.’ 
In the scenario of (21), the use of ne↑↓ is unnatural because the propositional content (the train arriving at the station) is expected not to cause a strong emo- tion in S.(21) (A married couple is on a train. They are head- ing home after they went to the movies, as they always do on Saturday evenings. After a 20 minute ride, the train arrives at their station, on time as usual. The husband says to the wife:)Tsuita-{a. ne↑/b. #ne(e)↑↓} arrive.Pst-ne‘We are there.’5 Other Uses of Ne Accompanied by a Question-Rise ContourNe accompanied by a question-rise contour has two additional uses to be distinguished from the CFC use: (i) the ⟨call for approval⟩ use, which can be taken to be an extension of the CFC use, and (ii) the ⟨offer/promise⟩ use, which can be taken to be an ex- tension of the ⟨call for approval⟩ use.8,95.1 The ⟨Call for Approval⟩ UseNe↗ in its ⟨call for approval⟩ use occurs on a clause that describes an action intended by S, and forms an interrogative where S asks H to confirm that he approves her action.8These two uses correspond to the “koodoo sengen (decla- ration of action)” use in Miyazaki et al. (2002: 279).9The sequence of the particle no and ne, and the sequence of n(o)desu (the polite present form of the discourse auxiliary noda) and ne, have a special usage that cannot be reduced to the meanings of the two components. That is, accompanied by the question-rise contour, they can be used to indicate that the utterance serves to provide background information about the content of what S is going so say subsequently, as illustrated in the following example (cf. Izuhara 1992: 165–167; Miyazaki et al. 2002: 186).(i) Kinoo hisashiburi-ni Shinjuku-ni yesterday for.the.first.time.in.a.long.time S.-Dat itta-{no/ndesu}-ne↗ Sooshitara, tamatama go.Pst-no/noda.Pst.Plt-ne then by.chance kookoo-jidai-no tomodachi-ni dekuwashite high.school-time-Gen friend-Dat come.across.Ger‘I went to Shinjuku yesterday for the first time in a long time. Then, I bumped into a friend from my high school days, and ... ’We do not regard this as another use of ne↗, because ne↗ cannot express this meaning by itself.(22) Kore kariru-ne↗ this borrow.Prs-ne‘I’ll borrow this, okay?’(23) Jaa, roku-ji-ni mata then 6-o’clock-Dat again mukae-ni-kuru-ne↗pick.up-come.Prs-ne‘Then, I’ll come back to pick you up at 6, okay?’It seems sensible to hypothesize that this use was derived from the ⟨call for confirmation⟩ use, via re- duction of the component: ‘it is okay (that)’ from utterances along the lines of (24).(24)5.2Kore karite-mo ii-ne↗this borrow.Ger-even.if good.Prs-ne‘It’s okay for me to borrow this, isn’t it↗’The ⟨Offer/Promise⟩ Use . . .Ne↗ is also used as a marker of commissive speech act (in Searle’s 1979 sense), such as offer and promise.(25) (S is at the airport, and says to a friend who gave her a ride:)Arigatoo. Omiyage katte kuru-ne↗ thank.you. gift buy.Ger come.Prs-ne ‘Thanks. I’ll buy you a gift (at my destina- tion).’(26) (Daisuke gives his colleague Kiriko small stuffed bears as a gift. Kiriko is delighted, and Daisuke says: “I am glad you like them”. In reply, Kiriko says:)Un, ki-ni itta. Taisestu-niyes mind-Dat enter.Pst impordant-Cop.Inf suru-ne↗do.Prs-ne‘Yes, I like them. I will cherish them!’10As discussed by Leech (2014: 180–186), a speech act meant to be beneficial to H can be to some extent face-threatening, being unwelcome for one reason or another, and a possible strategy to mitigate the threat is to present it in a form of request for per- mission (e.g. Can I get you a drink?, May I help you10Taken from the novel Tenshi wa moppu o motte by Fumie Kondo, published by Jitsugyo no Nihon Sha in 2003. 
with those bags?). The ⟨offer/promise⟩ use can thus naturally be regarded as as extension of the ⟨call for approval⟩ use.6 Other Uses of Ne Accompanied by a Insisting-Rise or Rise-Fall ContourNe accompanied by an insisting-rise or rise-fall con- tour has two additional uses that are to be distin- guished from the SI use, which we label: ⟨look-up⟩ and ⟨dismissive reaction⟩.6.1 The ⟨Look-Up⟩ UseAs discussed by Takubo and Kinsui (1997: 755) and Miyazaki et al. (2002: 279), ne has a function to in- dicate that S has obtained the information expressed by the sentence “on the spot” (i.e., in the scene of the conversation) by looking up her memory or some other information source, or through a process of re- flection.11 Ne with this meaning is not compatible with the question-rise contour, and is typically ac- companied by an insisting-rise contour.A: Docchi-ga katsu-to omou? which-Nom win.Prs-Quot think.Prs ‘Who do you think will win?’B: Uun, tabun, Itaria-ga katsu-ne↑ hmm probably Italy-Nom win.Prs-ne ‘Hmm, Italy probably will.’Quite often, ne of this kind appears in an utter- ance whose content is likely not something S needs particular efforts to retrieve or figure out. Such in- stances are easily found in answers by celebrities, writers, etc., to interview questions, as in (30) and (31).(30) Chooshi-ga yoi-to omou condition-Nom good.Prs-Quot think.Prs toki-wa arimasu-ga, sooiu time-Th exist.Prs.Plt-although suchtoki-no hoo-ga utareru koto-ga time-Gen way-Nom hit.Psv.Prs matter-Nom ooi-desu.

On the contrary, when I feel like I’m in bad condition, I tend to do well.’12(31) (in reply to the question: “How often do you go out for research (for your novels)?”)Shuzai-wa amari shinai-desu-ne↑ research-Th much do.Neg.Prs-PltAux.Prs-ne ‘I do not go out for research very often.’13We suggest that, in such cases, the primary purpose of the use of ne is to communicate the message that S is talking sincerely so that she pays minute atten- tion to what she says and what particular words she12Taken from a web article based on an interview with the baseball player Takuya Asao (http://www.mizuno.jp/ zone/2013/03/post-sp1.html; checked on July 23, 2015).13Taken from an interview with the novelist Ira Ishida that appeared in the book IWGP konpuriito gaido, published by Bungeishunju in 2012.(27) A:Yamada-san-nonaisen bangoo Y.-Suffix-Gen extension number shitte ru?know.Ger IpfvAux.Prs‘Do you know Yamada’s extension num- ber?’(B looks up his pocketbook.)B: Eeto, 5524-da-ne↑um 5524-Cop.Prs-ne ‘Let me see, it is 5524.’(28) (in reply to: “Do you know where Aoki is from?”)Eeto, tashika, Kyuushuu-no um if.I.remember.right Kyushu-Gen dokoka-desu-ne↑somewhere-Cop.Prs.Plt-ne‘Let me see, if I remember right, he is from somewhere in the Kyushu region.’(29) (A soccer match between Italy and Spain is about to start.)11The ⟨look-up⟩ use corresponds to Takubo and Kinsui’s (1997: 755) “self-confirmation” use, and Miyazaki et al.’s (2002: 279–280) “jiko kakunin (self-confirmation)” and “kaisoo (recollection)’ uses.  
chooses.It is not clear to us whether the extent of the ⟨look-up⟩ use should be considered broad enough to cover cases such as (32) and (33). One might consider it more appropriate to posit a distinct use to deal with such occurrences, whose semantic contribution is quite hard to pin down anyway.(32) (Haruo sees his old acquaintance Tomie for the first time in years in their home village. Tomie now runs an old inn there.)S: “Then you should stay at my inn.” H: “Doyouhaveanyvacancy?”S: “Yes, small rooms are available.” H: Jaa, onegai-shitai-ne↑then ask.want.Prs-ne‘Then, I’d like to ask for it.’14(33) (a conversation between two French chefs Paul and Jean, who have had Japanese kaiseki cui- sine, and a Japanese chef Shizuo)P: “Listen, Jean. I wonder if we can serve French cuisine in this way – serve a vari- ety of dishes in small portions. Don’t you think that would make a whole new kind of French cuisine? ”be more suitable if S wants to make it clear that she sympathizes with H’s situation.(34) (H wants to be at the Tokyo station by 6 p.m., butisnotsureifhecanmakeitbythen.

(21)).(35) (the same context as in (27))J: “Yeah, I agree.”P: “Shizuo, what do you think?” S: Wareware-ni-wa arigatai-ne↑Ima-no we-Dat-Th good.Prs-ne now-GenB: Iya-da-ne↑ annoying-Cop.Prs-ne‘Nope, I don’t want to do it.’Furansu-ryoori-wa, wareware France-cuisine-Th we Nihon-jin-ni-wa ryoo-ga Japan-people-Dat-Th amount-Nom oosugiru-kara-ne. too.much.Prs-because-ne‘That would work well for us. Portions sizes of the French cuisine as we know it are too large for us Japanese.’15Parallel to the case of the SI use, ne↑↓ can be used to express a meaning similar to that of ne↑ in its ⟨look-up⟩ use, but conveying an added emotive tone. In the context of (34), the choice of ne↑↓ will14Adapted from the novel Ten ni nobotta otoko by Soji Shi- mada, published by Kobunsha in 1994.15Adapted from the novel Bimi raisan by Yasuhisa Ebisawa published by Bungeishunju in 1992.(37) A:Yapparisonnamononai-njaafter.all such thing absent.Prs-noda.Inf nai-ka-na.NegAux.Prs-Q-DP‘I feel like there isn’t such a thing, after all.’6.2B’: #Eeto, 5524-da-ne(e)↑↓ um 5524-Cop.Prs-ne (Let me see, it is 5524.)The ⟨Dismissive Reaction⟩ UseNe↑ further has a function to express S’s dismissive attitude against the preceding utterance by H.16(36) A:Soko-o nantoka tanomu-yo.there-Acc somehow ask.Prs-DP‘I know I am asking too much, but could you do it, by any chance?’B: Aru-ne↑ exist.Prs-ne‘But there is.’While iya-da-ne in (16B) conveys a sympathetic at- titude, the same phrase in (36B) conveys a contrary, rejecting attitude. The two are pronounced with the same intonation contour, although they may be dis-16Miyazaki et al. (2002: 80) refer to this use as “kyozetsu hyoomei (expression of rejection)”.  
tinguishable in some cases based on other phonetic features.It is not clear to us if it is also possible to use ne↑↓ to express this meaning. The following quote by the manager Tatsunori Hara of the professional baseball team Yomiuri Giants might be taken to involve such an instance.17(38) (at the press conference after a lost game on June 16th, 2011, in reply to a journal- ist’s request: “Could you recapitulate today’s game?”)Sookatsu-nante dekinai-nee↑↓ recapitulation-Top do.Pot.Neg.Prs-ne San-mon!

Ask them now!’187 Semantic Connections between the Different Uses of NeIn this section, we briefly discuss the conceptual links between the uses of ne discussed so far. Al- though consideration of historical facts will be cru- cial in determining how the polysemy of ne arose (cf. Onodera 2004),19 here we consider synchronic facts only and leave diachronic investigation for the future research.There is an obvious semantic conceptual link be- tween the CFC and SI uses, both involving S’s ex- pectation that H believes the expressed proposition (prior to the utterance). Also, as mentioned earlier, it seems plausible that the ⟨offer/promise⟩ use his- torically arose from ⟨call for approval⟩ use, which in turn arose from the CFC use.17We do not have access to the audio, but the transcription in news articles, with an extra vowel letter, suggests that ne was accompanied by a rise-fall contour.18From a web article on July 23rd, 2014 (http:// www.daily.co.jp/general/flash/20130906278. shtml; checked on July 23, 2015).19According to Yamaguchi and Akimoto (2001: 608–609), the earliest documented uses of the discourse particle ne are from the late Edo period (the late 17th century onward), and its etymological origin has not been identified. Another discourse particle na, whose functions largely overlap with those of ne (Miyazaki et al. 2002: 281–283), is much older and is attested in writings from the Nara period (A.D. 710–784; Yamaguchi and Akimoto 2001: 544).We furthermore suggest that the ⟨look-up⟩ and ⟨dismissive reaction⟩ uses are connected to the SI use via the notion of unquestionability, or estab- lishedness. The SI use involves S’s expectation that the propositional content has already been part of the interlocutors’ common belief/knowledge. That both interlocutors agree that p prior to the utterance im- plies that p is established, at least between them. A proposition can be unquestionable/established, how- ever, without H knowing it beforehand. If it is stated in certain kinds of information source, say an official train timetable or phone directory, it can be a good reason to regard it as established. I thus propose that the ⟨look-up⟩ use, in its origin, involves indication of the status of the propositional content as estab- lished.20 Wehastentonote,however,thatwearenot claiming that a contemporary speaker using ne in its ⟨look-up⟩ use presents the propositional content as established. Our claim is merely that the notion of establishedness might have played a crucial role in the development of the ⟨look-up⟩ use.In using ne in its ⟨dismissive reaction⟩ use, S re- fuses to let H question the propositional content. One effective way to fend off those who doubt or challenge the truth of a certain proposition will be to present it as if it were an established fact. It seems thus sensible to hypothesize that the property of ne as an indicator of establishedness is behind the de- velopment of the ⟨dismissive reaction⟩ use as well.8 SummaryThis work discussed the functions of the discourse particle ne occurring in declarative clauses, pay- ing special attention to how they interact with in- tonation contours. Ne with the question-rise con- tour has three functions, i.e., ⟨call for confirmation⟩, ⟨call for approval⟩, and ⟨offer/promise⟩. Ne with the insisting-rise contour, too, has three functions, i.e.,20Takubo and Kinsui (1997: 755–757) put forth a different account of the link between the ⟨call for confirmation⟩ and ⟨look-up⟩ uses. They argue that the two uses do not differ in meaning, ne invariably indicating that S is verifying her as- sumption (with or without the help of H) at the scene of the conversation. They do not, however, address the fact that the two uses are associated with different intonations (which is hard to account for under the monosemy hypothesis). It must also be noted that at least some occurrences of ne in its ⟨shared information⟩ and ⟨dismissive reaction⟩ uses do not involve “ver- ification by the speaker” in any clear sense (e.g., (20B), (36B)).  
⟨shared information⟩, ⟨look-up⟩, and ⟨dismissive reaction⟩. Ne with the rise-fall contour might re- place ne accompanied by the insisting-rise contour, but additionally conveying an emotive tone.ReferencesOsamu Hashimoto. 1992.
