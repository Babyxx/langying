Real-time Detection and Sorting of News on Microblogging PlatformsAbstractJ. L and J. Yang, 2011; F. Z. et al, 2012). As an in- stance, (F. Z. et al, 2012) assumes that bursty topics in microblogs correspond to events that have attract- ed the most online attention. To find such events, this work uses a model to detect busty topics, as- suming that a global event is likely to follow a time- dependent global topic distribution. Although detec- tion methods relying on the propagation characteris- tics of microblogs are based on reasonable assump- tions, they have certain limitations. First, some mi- croblogs not related to news have very similar prop- agation characteristics as news microblogs. For ex- ample, a microblog with a promotion or a gift may follow a similar propagation pattern as a popular news event. Second, propagation behavior can on- ly be analyzed after a microblog has been posted for a certain amount of time. Previous work on news de- tection based on propagation knowledge cannot per- form real-time detection, since propagation knowl- edge can only be obtained a period of time after mi- croblogs are published. Some works explicitly men- tion that trying to detect microblogs using propaga- tion knowledge in a short time reduces the effective- ness. For example, in (G. L. et al, 2010), experi- ments on Twitter data show that using 1-day prop- agation knowledge can mainly detect topics related to daily activities; only by using a 2-days history this method can detect some real emerging topics.Therefore, using propagation characteristics is not a good idea if the objective is to detect news as soon as possible. An additional challenge is how to sort and present the newborn news microblogs according to their importance, Most of the current news de- tection platforms sort the microblogs by their pub-Due to the increasing popularity of microblog- ging platforms (e.g., Twitter), detecting real- time news from microblogs (e.g., tweets) has recently drawn a lot of attention. Most of the previous work on this subject detect news by analyzing propagation patterns of microblogs. This approach has two limitations: (i) many non-news microblogs (e.g. marketing activi- ties) have propagation patterns similar to news microblogs and therefore they can be false- ly reported as news; (ii) using propagation patterns to identify news involves a time de- lay until the pattern is formed, therefore news are not detected in real time. We propose an alternative approach, which, motivated by the necessity of real-time detection of news, does not rely on propagation of posts. More- over, we propose a real-time sorting strategy that orders the detected news microblogs us- ing a translational approach. An experimen- tal evaluation on a large-scale microblogging dataset demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach.1 IntroductionMicroblogging platforms (e.g., Twitter or SinaWei- bo) have become very popular and their role as news media has been recognized. As people actively talk about what is happening, microblogs are the place where the first-hand news appear. Actually, over 85% of the leading topics on Twitter are news by nature (H. P et al, 2010).Most of the recent works on news detection from microblogs rely on using temporal patterns of propa- gation (G. L. et al, 2010; R. G. and K. Lerman, 2010;
lication time or their popularity. However, at any point in time, there can be lots of newborn news mi- croblogs all of which have close publication time; thus, sorting them by the publication time may fail to show important news on the top. Besides, as we mentioned before, newborn news microblogs have limited prorogation information; thus, it is very dif- ficult to access the popularity of newborn news mi- croblogs. In this paper, we propose an alternative system for detecting and sorting microblogs with news in real time. Our framework does not rely on any propagation knowledge. Our system consists of three modules: news-microblog expert detection, news microblog detection, and news sorting. We ob- serve that there exists a group of expert users, whose microblogs are all of a single type (e.g., news). In the first module, we apply a methodology for select- ing expert users based on their professionalism and activity. By simulating the training corpus as the mi- croblogs by the experts, the second module builds an ensemble classifier to detect news microblogs. The ensemble model combines weak classifiers trained from the corpora of different experts into a strong classifier. Moreover, it can be updated with low cost: once an expert posts some news microblogs, we only need to update the module corresponding to its cor- pus instead of the whole model. The third module defines a score for each detected news microblog, in order to rank these microblogs. In this module, we firstly propose a novel text representation called Behavior-Actor-Venue bag of words (BAVbow) for news microblogs which consolidates the most infor- mative text from them. Then, we apply value trans- fer with confidence on the BAVbow representation, using the scores of the training corpus to rank the new microblogs whose scores are unknown.We conduct experiments on data obtained from the microblogging service SinaWeibo, one of the most popular sites in China, used by well over 30% of Chinese Internet users, with a similar market pen- etration as Twitter. The effectiveness of each module is verified based on information collected by a group of users.The remainder of this paper is organized as fol- lows. In Section 2, we introduce our methodology by discussing in detail the news detection framework and the three sub-modules. Section 3 presents our experimental analysis. We conclude the paper andsuggest directions for possible future work in Sec- tion 4.2 Our methodologyOur system includes three modules. In a training session, the News-microblog Expert Detection mod- ule detects a set of microblogging users who active- ly post news microblogs. The posts by these experts forms the training corpus of news microblogs, used to train the other two modules: the Expert-ensemble Classifier and the BAV Sorter. The Expert-ensemble Classifier (Section 2.2) is used to classify newborn microblogs to news or non-news. It combines base classifiers constructed from the experts’ corpus by considering the professionalism and activity degrees of experts. The BAV Sorter module (Section 2.3) provides a new representation method for news mi- croblogs and employs a value transfer strategy to de- fine an importance score for each new post classified as news by the Expert-ensemble Classifier. After the system has been trained, the newly posted mi- croblogs can be classified as news/non-news by the Expert-ensemble Classifier, and those posts detected to be news can be ranked according to their impor- tance by the BAV Sorter module. In the remainder of this section, we describe in detail the three modules.2.1 News-microblog Expert DetectionSince microblogging data are large and they are up- dated at a high rate, it is not possible to manually label them. As an alternative, we propose an auto- matic corpus construction method, motivated by the observation that there exists a group of users whose microblogs are of a single type only. In the news domain, some real-world examples include: @头 条新闻 (#breaking news#) from SinaWeibo and @BBCWorld from Twitter, which always post news microblogs. Next, we present our methodology for finding out these users which we call news experts. The selection strategy considers two characteristics of users: professionalism and activity.2.1.1 Expert Candidates Retrieval via User ProfileMicroblogging platforms have a very large num- ber of users and it is impossible to analyze the mi- croblogs written by all of them. Thus, it is neces- sary to select a subset of them, which is expected
to include the news experts. Search for news ex- perts will then be confined to this subset. There are two types of data that describe a user: his/her profile and the microblogs he/she posts. Profile informa- tion can be divided into three parts: (i), Description: This part includes usernames and other descriptive data given by the users themselves. (ii), Author- ity: Microblogging platforms provide verification- s for some users, called verified accounts. Verifi- cation is currently used to establish authenticity in Twitter. The verified badge helps users toward dis- covering high-quality sources of information. (iii), Influence: A natural feature that indicates the influ- ence of a microblogging user is the number of fol- lowers, since this number indicates how many peo- ple are reading the user’s posts. After analyzing a certain amount of users whose microblogs focus on news, we found that some discriminative character- istics exist in their profiles. First, their descriptions always contain some keywords related to the type of microblogs they focus on (“新闻” and news, in the examples). Second, all of them have verified ac- counts. Third, they have high influence, i.e., they have at least a certain number of followers.Therefore, to retrieve candidates of news expert- s, we can first define some news-related keywords W = {w1, w2, . . . , wn} and obtain candidate users to be news experts as follows. For each wi ∈ W , we define a set ec (wi ) by selecting from the set of users those who (i) have wi contained in their description, (ii) are verified, and (iii) have at least θ followers. Then, the set EC of expert candidates is defined by E c = ∪ni=1 ec (wi ). Note that both of the keyword set W and θ can be seen as model parameters; they influence the number of retrieved expert candidates. For example, decreasing θ increases the number of candidates exponentially, therefore θ should be se- lected to be relatively large (e.g., we set θ =1,000 in our experiments). Still, as we will see next, since only the k most important candidates will be select- ed in the end as experts, the overall training cost of our system is not very sensitive to these parameters.2.1.2 Selection of Professional and Active Experts among CandidatesAfter finding the set Ec of expert candidates, our method, as its second step, defines a score for each user in Ec, which quantifies the candidate’s appro-priateness. The selection is based on the follow- ing rules: (i) microblogs posted by experts should focus on the type we are interested in (i.e., news), (ii) experts should be active, so that they provide time-relevant microblogs to be used in training our classification model. Thus, a candidate expert is more professional if a large percentage of his/her microblogs belong to the type. The more active the expert is, the more up-to-date his/her corpus is and the more adaptive it is to newborn microblogs.Based on the above, we define the professional- ism and activity degree of each candidate. To mea- sure the professionalism of a candidate ec ∈ E C , we need to use a classifier which indicates whether a post by ec is a piece of news. However, when the system is firstly used, we do not have a training set for such a classifier. To tackle this problem, we define a special corpus called exterior-professional corpus, which is not taken from microblogging plat- forms but from professional news sources, e.g., news web sites. We use the content of these sites to train a classifier C to evaluate the professionalism degree of news-expert candidates. Note that the resulting classifier is not expected to be very accurate, since it is based on a corpus that does not consist of mi- croblogs. However, here we only need C to rank the candidates based on their professionalism and this classifier does a good job in this direction: more professional experts typically get higher classifica- tion accuracy. Another problem is that the exterior- professional corpus only contains positive instances, while to train a classifier, we usually also need neg- ative instances. This issue could be alleviated by the use of one-class classification methods (M. Y. and L.M. Manevitz, 2002). As an alternative, in our case (i.e., news detection), we construct a corpus of non-news microblogs as follows: we randomly ex- tract microblogs from users not in the candidate set Ec and use microblogs by them with short content and limited forwarding. These microblogs have low probability to be news microblogs.For each expert candidate eci ∈ Ec, we extract re- cent posts (e.g., posted during time interval [Tb, Te], where Te is the extraction time ) by eci as MTi . Then, we compute (i) eci’s professionalism degree usingpc n′classifier C: f (ei ) = n , where n is the numberof posts in MTi and n′ is the number of posts in 
MTi classified as news by C; (ii) eci ’s activity degreeas her posting frequency in a recent time interval(e.g., the last month): f a (eci ) = n , Te −max(Tb,Tui)where Tui is the time when eci registered at the mi- croblogging platform. Then, the PA score f s (eci ) is computed for the candidate as a weighted average of the user’s normalized professionalism and activ- ity (based on a weighing parameter α). Finally, the k users in Ec with the highest PA scores are selected as experts.2.2 Expert-ensemble Classifier for Detecting News-MicroblogsAfter obtaining a set of news experts (denoted as E) and their PA values, we utilize them to construct a classification model to identify whether a microblog is related to news. Considering this, we make use of the ensemble learning theory (Z. Zhou, 2012) to construct a classifier that detects news microblogs. First, given an expert ei ∈ E, we build a base classi- fier Ci corresponding to ei’s corpus (i.e., ei’s recen- t microblogs). To select an appropriate model for the base classifier in our experimental part, we first performed a comparison among the possible meth- ods for training (not included in this paper, due to space constraints), and decided to use Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB) (G. P. et al, 2006), owing to its good performance. Naive Bayes methods are a set of supervised learning algorithms based on applying Bayes’ theorem with the “naive” assumption of in- dependence between every pair of features. MNB is one of the two classic Naive Bayes variants used in text classification, where the data are typically repre- sented as vectors of word counts and tf-idf vectors. Note that other classification methods also can be used for constructing base classifiers. Users of our methodology can select by comparing performance of different classification methods in their own data.After k base classifiers C1, C2, · · · , Ck are built (one for each of the k experts), when a newborn mi- croblog m is posted, we can obtain a prediction from each Ci (i = 1,··· ,k) on whether m is a news mi- croblog. We use a indication function fiC to “bina- rize” the output of Ci: If Ci classifies input m as news, we set fiC(m) = 1; otherwise fiC(m) = −1.Finally, by taking the PA values as weights, we aggregate the predictions of k base classifiers to asingle prediction in the ensemble manner:∑kf N (m) = f S (ei ) × fiC (m). (1)i=1A positive f N (m) value indicates that m is a newsmicroblog.We use ensemble theory to construct the classifierfor the following reasons. First, it matches the struc- ture of input data (news experts’ microblogs and PA values). Moreover, PA values are proportional to the confidence of the prediction based on each expert’s corpus, since a more processional and active corpus derives a more accurate prediction in principle. Last, the ensemble can be updated at a low cost: the final model (Equation 1) is a linear combination of the sub-models (i.e., Ci’s); each Ci is based on the cor- pus of a single news expert eci. Therefore, if one expert’s corpus is updated (e.g., ei posts a number of new microblogs), only one sub-model (e.g., Ci) needs to be updated.2.3 BAV SortingThe output of the ensemble classifier is just whether a newborn microblog is related to news. Therefore it is likely that a large number of newborn microblogs are classified as news. In order not to overwhelm the user of our system with a potentially huge number of news items, we can rank the items and present to the user only the most important ones. Howev- er, most of the research on ranking microblogs fo- cus on subjective criteria (e.g., search-based (Y. D- uan et al, 2010) or personalized ranking (W. C and I. Uysal, 2011)), which are not suitable for our prob- lem (i.e., the detected newborn news are not based on search keywords or some user). Moreover, the ensemble prediction score (output of Equation 1) is proportional to the confidence of the predicted label, which may be independent to the importance of the classified news post. Therefore, we propose a nov- el ranking method for newborn news microblogs, called Behavior-Actor-Venue based Sorting (BAV sorting, for short). Firstly, for informatively repre- senting news microblogs, we propose method called Behavior-Actor-Venue BOW (BAVbow). Then, we apply a value-transfer with confidence method to transfer the knowledge of user-defined scores on a training set of microblogs, to the newborn mi- croblogs, which can then be ranked based on their 
predicted scores.2.3.1 Behavior-Actor-Venue RepresentationBefore text analysis, a common pre-processing approach bag of words (BOW)(J. L. et al, 2009) converts each document to a set of words, disre- garding grammar and even word order. The BOW result is typically improved by eliminating uninfor- mative or noisy terms. Recall that our work focus- es on news microblogs; the most important com- ponents of a news item can be obtained by three questions: “Where it happened” (Venue),“Who did it” (Actor), and “Did what” (Behavior). Therefore, we design a representation model called Behavior- Actor-Venue Bag-Of-Word (BAVbow) for analyzing news microblogs, which only keeps terms related to the information structure of news. These terms are extracted by making use of natural language pro- cessing (NLP) techniques, more specifically Part- Of-Speech (POS) tagging (S. J. DeRose, 1988) and Named Entity Recognition (NER) (F. Abedini et al, 2011). A common use of POS tagging is the iden- tification of words as nouns, verbs, adjectives, ad- verbs, etc. NER locates and classifies atomic el- ements in text into predefined categories such as names of persons, organizations, locations, expres- sions of times, quantities, monetary values, percent- ages, etc. In news microblogs, verbs always indicate “Did what” (Behavior); persons and organization- s recognized by NER always represent “Who did it” (Actors); “Where it happened” (Venues) can be found via Location terms (also recognized by NER). Therefore, in BAVbow, only verbs and nouns related to people, organizations, or locations are kept. For example, a BAVbow representation of “In this morn- ing, Lee had a big parade in Beijing.” is {Lee, had, parade, Beijing}.2.3.2 Importance-Value Transfer with Confidence (VTC)To assess the importance value V I (m) of a new- born microblog m in a BAVbow representation, we make use of the concept of knowledge transfer; i.e., we transfer the knowledge about the importance val- ues of old microblogs to the unknown values of new- born microblogs. There are several ways to define the importance values of old microblogs. One nat- ural idea is employing the popularity (propagationcharacteristics) to calculate the importance value. For example, in the experimental part, we simulate the importance value of an old news microblog by how fast it spread among users of the platform. To model the spread of an item m, we use the num- ber of reviews nr (m) and forwards nf (m) of m in a certain time window after m was published (e.g., one month):VI(m) = nr(m)+βnf(m), (2) β is a parameter to control the proportion of two terms.An alternative way to implement this approach is to allow the users to rate the old news microblogs by themselves. Then the final order of news microblogs will conform to the subjective perception or interest of the users. For example, if they are more interested in news in some categories (e.g., technology), they would give higher values to the old microblogs in these categories; if they are more interested in some particular authors, they would value higher the old microblogs posted by or related to these authors.Once we we have a training set of microblogs Mtr whose V al values are already known (i.e., computed based on spread values or defined by real experts), we can employ VTC to predict the V al- based ranking of news microblogs Mte whose V al values are unknown yet, i.e., Mte is a set of new- born microblogs classified as news by our ensemble classifier.VTC compares the BAVbow representation BAVbow(mj) of each mj ∈ Mte to the BAVbow representations of all mi ∈ Mtr, in order to transfer the V al values of microblogs in Mtr to V I (mj ), based on the similarity of the representations. The intuition behind the transfer strategy is shown by the following example. Consider two posts m1 and m2 with different but overlapping BAVbow representa- tions:BAVbow(m1): Lee parade BeijingBAVbow(m2): Lee paradeKnowing that m2 is important provides strong evi- dence that m1 is at least somewhat important. How- ever, knowing that m1 is very important does not al- low us to conclude that m2 is, since the importance value of m1 might also stem from Beijing. Thus, we can infer that, considering a microblog mi of Mtr and a microblog mj of Mte, if the term set of mj contains a large proportion of terms in mi, then
V I (mi ) is transferred to V I (mj ) with high confi- dence. We define the confidence value of transfer- ring the value of mi to mj as follows:news website1. Besides, as negative samples for our professionalism classifier C (see Section 2.1.2), we selected a non-news microblogging corpus of nreal- time 300,000 microblogs. Each has less than 30 Chi- nese characters and less than 50 forwards.Finally, we obtained 486 expert candidates and their PA values. The parameter α, which is used in combining professionalism and activity was set to 0.6, giving slightly higher weight to professional- ism. Cross-validation (R.Kohavi et al, 2012) could be used to fine-tune this value. Table 1 indicatively shows the expert candidates with the top 3 and bot- tom 3 PA values. By analyzing their profiles and the microblogs posted by these candidates, we observed thatmostofthesecandidateshavepotentialtobe news experts since, compared to other users, their microblogs are more focused on news.2 In order to verify the suitability of our ranking over these can- didates (i.e., the suitability of the PA values obtained by our method), we estimated their real profession- alism and activity as follows. For each candidate, we extracted the 10 most recently posted microblogs. The number of real news microblogs (as labeled by our invited evaluators) in the fragment (denoted as News in 10) and the timespan of the microblog se- quence (denoted as Time for 10) are shown in the last two columns of Table 1. By looking at these results, we can see that the PA order indeed reflect- s the professionalism (i.e., high News in 10 value) and activity (i.e., low Time for 10 value) of the user- s.After obtaining the expert candidates and their PA values, we select the k candidates with the highest PA values to be the news experts. In order to deter- mine k, we examine the PA values of the 467 can- didates in our experiment in decreasing order. By looking closely at this sequence at the area around the 100th expert, we observe that there are several relatively sharp drops. In order to select the best k, we compute the moving average (the window size equals to 20) and compare it with the individual PA values. We select the PA value having the largest dif- ference from the moving average value at that point. This value corresponds to the 109-th rank, thus we select k =108.1 http://news.sina.com.cn/media.html2This observation is verified by the invited evaluators famil- iar with Chinese media.VC |BAVbow(mi) ∩ BAVbow(mj)| (mi → mj) = |BAVbow(mi)| , (3) where | · | denotes the cardinality of the enclosed set. Specifically, for each document mj ∈ Mte, we consider each document mi ∈ Mtr, compute the corresponding confidence V C (mi → mj ), and then transfer the V al value of mi, with V C(mi → mj)as a weight, to mj:∑iVI(mi)×VC(mi →mj)V (mj)= |mi∈MtrVC(mi→mj)̸=0|; (4)The denominator of Equation 4 is the number of posts in Mtr for which the transfer confidence to mj is non-zero. The objective of VTC is to sort the newborn microblogs mj ∈ Mte in increasing order of their predicted importance values V I (mj ).3 Experimental EvaluationIn this section, we evaluate the effectiveness our pro- posed system. To test our method on news mining from microblogging platforms, we applied it on a collection of microblogs with no propagation knowl- edge from the SinaWeibo platform. To assess the accuracy of our results, we invited 10 experts to pro- vide correct labels (news vs non-news) to the tested microblogs. All these experts have journalism and linguistics background and their help is acknowl- edged at the end of the paper. In our evaluation, we divide 1,000 test examples of microblogs in 10 fold- s. The real labels (i.e., news/non-news) of each fold (containing 100 cases) are evaluated by the experts.3.1 Experiments on News-Expert RetrievalAs introduced in Section 2.1, our system con- structs a microblogging training corpus by select- ing news experts. We first define some news relat- ed keywords W ={新闻#news#,日报#dairly#, 时报#times#, 晨报, 晚报, 周报, #newspaper#} and then use them as queries to obtain news expert candidates with the threshold θ of minimum number of followers set to 1,000. For constructing the exte- rior professional corpus, we extracted 70,000 news titles for the period 2008/01/01-2012/12/31 from aI

The test set (scale: 610,000 microblogs) was collected during January 2013 from about 32,000 users, randomly select- ed from the whole set of SinaWeibo users. We trained our model (denoted as Expert-ensemble pa) to classify the test microblogs. Here, we compare our method with a natural method as the baseline (denoted as Single), which is used in TwitterStand (J. Sankaranarayanan et al, 2009): combine the mi- croblogs from all news experts into a single corpus and train a single classifier. Moreover, to evalu- ate the fitness of using PA values to be ensemble weights, we also compared our method with Ma- jority Voting (T. G. Dietterich, 2000) (denoted as Expert-ensemble mv) which is a popular method in ensemble learning.Since the scale of test microblogs is too large, we randomly selected 1,000 of them (including 400 pre- dicted news results and 600 predicted non-news re- sults) and asked our evaluators to label them. Based on the labeling and the prediction by the classifiers, we derived the average performance of the classi- fiers as shown in Table 2. As Table 2 indicates, our method outperforms the Single classifier in all evalu- ation terms, especially in the precision of news cate- gory. This indicates that although the Single method can extract most of the news microblogs (i.e. not a bad recall on news), the predicted news microblogsare mixed with a significant number of non-news mi- croblogs. On the other hand, our method uses the PA values of experts as confidences of the individual classifiers in the ensemble and this gives a large im- provement in the accuracy of news microblogs clas- sification. Another observation is that the accuracy in predicting non-news is higher than that of predict- ing news. In other words, the probability of mistak- ing a news item as a non-news microblog is low- er than taking a non-news item as news microblog. Since the cost of mistaking news as non-news mi- croblogs is higher, this result can be considered good for real-world applications.3.3 Experiments on BAV SortingOur method is independent of the definition of im- portance value V al for news, which may vary in different applications. In this experiment, we use as V al the spread range (as defined by Eq. 2 with β = 4 and a one-month time window) of mi- croblogs written by news experts during 01/01/2012 to 31/12/2012. The test microblogs are taken from detected news microblogs from the classification ex- periment (Section 3.2).Our sorting method is based on (i) the BAVbow representation and (ii) the Value Transfer with Con- fidence (VTC) approach. To evaluate the effective- ness of using both BAVbow and VTC (BAVbow + VTC) and using BOW and VTC (BOW + VTC), with a random ordering of news (Random). The comparison between BAVbow + VTC and BOW + VTC shows the effectiveness of our proposed BAVbow representation. The comparison between

For reducing the contingency of Random, we perform the comparison on 10 folds (each fold has 100 test microblogs) and average the results. For exploring the relationship between the real order and the order predicted by our method, in Figure 1, we show the average predicted rank sequences (BAVbow (or BOW) + VTC rank) as a function of the real ranked sequence (1 − 100). To assess the relationship between the real order3 and the predicted order, we also plot the smoothed lines (by minimizing the least squares error) for BAVbow (or BOW) + VTC. Besides, we include lines corre- sponding to a Random order and the perfect order prediction.positively correlated with the correct ranking, as op- posed to the Random line. We note that we also test- ed a method, which ranks the news posts according to the output of Equation 1 (i.e., confidence of the ensemble classifier) and found that its effectiveness is similar to that of the Random ordering.4 ConclusionWe have proposed a methodology for real-time news detection and sorting from microblogging platform- s. Our approach automatically selects a set of users who are microblogging news experts. Based on the microblogs already posted by these expert users, to- gether with the professionalism and activity knowl- edge of experts, we build an expert-ensemble clas- sifier for detecting news microblogs. Then, new- born microblogs, which do not have any prorogation knowledge, will be classified as news or non-news ones. Going one step further, we propose a BAVbow + VTC sorting approach, which orders the detected news microblogs based on their expected value.ReferencesF. Abedini, F. Mahmoudi, and A. Jadidinejad.
