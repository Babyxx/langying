Ethnic Stereotypes in Mass Media: content analysis and language peculiarities(on the materials of Egemen Kazakhstan, Kazakhiya newspapers)AbstractThe significance of investigating ethnic stereotypes found in publications in the mass media is explained by its' influence on the retention of ethnic identification of a nation in a multinational country, ethnic classification, accommodation to the ethnic environment, and mainly, maintenance of balanced inter-ethnic relations in the society. In view of the fact that Kazakhstan is one of the multinational countries we have conducted content analysis of the ethnical stereotypes in national newspaper "Egemen Kazakhstan", as well as, independent political and social newspaper "Kazakhiya".During the quality analysis of the quantitative results of the content analysis of the ethnic stereotypes given in Egemen Kazakhstan and Kazakhiya newspapers it was determined that it has a positive effect on retention of ethnic identification of a nation in a multinational country, ethnic classification, accommodation to the ethnic environment, and mainly, maintenance of balanced inter-ethnic relations in the society. The ethnic stereotypes in the materials of mentioned publications appear by means of different linguistic tools. In particular, implicit syntactic constructions that tend to have ethnic stereotypes are frequent. The ethnic stereotypes shaped during ages, independent of cultural and informative factors and apt to variance, created under the influence of historical, cultural factors inconstant ethnic stereotypes are revealed in the mentioned publications.1 The timeliness of investigating the ethnic stereotypes in the mass media publications Development of balanced inter ethnic relations in any multinational country is the main issue in the preservation of peace full life and stable economic development of the country. In this regard, along with the government measuresfor the development of international relation in the country, the role of ethnic information and the ethnic stereotypes given in the mass media is peculiar.According to the investigators "ethnic stereotypes occupy a significant place in social consciousness and individual apperception, it serves, firstly, for the preservation of ethnic identity, secondly, for ethnic unification, and thirdly, accommodation of the ethnic group to the environment. Nowadays the ethnicstereotypes are included to the ideology and becoming the main tool of ideological compains. Ethnic stereotypes possess orientative feature in interethnic relations, because it can give information about the possible habits, customs, and behaviors that can occur in inter individual as well as interethnic communication with each and every representative of an ethnos beforehand" (Gladkih, 2001).One of the investigation of the most significant theme in interethnic communication as ethnic stereotypes in such a multinational country as Kazakhstan is the work of L. Nazarova (2001) in psychology, a scientist from near abroad, whose investigation were limited to the appearance of ethnic stereotypes in the specific linguistic consciousness of the North Kazakhstani citizens, but most important does not investigate the ethnic stereotypes in mass media and their appearance in the consciousness of Kazakhstani citizens, possible positive or negative influence on the international communication. Hence the in the investigations of the domestic scientists ethnic stereotypes in mass media is not considered as one of the main themes.The short works of R. Karymsakova and Z. Amirova (2010) are more likely to be dedicated to the issues of international communication in mass media, rather than to the ethnic stereotypes.For this reason, the national Egemen Kazakhstan and socio-political at the same time independent Kazakhiya newspapers were investigation targets in the investigation of ethnic stereotypes in respect to their linguistic peculiarities, that can describe the interethnic communication and can influence their development on a certain level. Content analysis of the publication based on the ethnic stereotypes in newspapers.In this regard, in order to determine the ethnic content-context orientability of the publications in Egemen Kazakhstan and Kazakhiya newspapers content analysis was applied, it is defined in terms of "method for identification of a specific content description and evaluation technique of various informational resources and texts", "a scientific technique that allows to make conclusions on social nature and conditions, and especially, on the source of the publication by
analyzing the text of the article" or "modification of textual information into numeric figures" (Suleimenova, 2008) and investigates ethnic lexemes in ethnic publications, ethnic stereotypes and lexical-semantic, as well as linguistic peculiarities of auto-hetero-stereotypes. Herein, the ethnic stereotypes that are determined by "the presence of evaluative views of inherent to one nation properties, and instructions that one should be guided by or adhere to when communicating with the mentioned nation, including relatively constant concepts of inherent to a nation moral, mental and physical attributes" are divided into auto- and heterostereotypes. If the auto stereotypes include the self- evaluation, concepts, and opinion of one nation concerning its peculiar qualities, the heterostereotypes comprise more or less constant standardized concepts of one nation concerning a quality contained in the other.Consequently, the content analysis was carried out only on the ethnic materials from national newspaper Egemen Kazakhstan and independent socio-political newspaper Kazakhiya published in the period from January to June, 2015 and obtain ethnic stereotypes on "countries and nations, national or ethnic traditions and national ethnic values, including interethnic relations, ethnic policy, and potential (achievements, drawbacks, peculiarities, customs )of the nation in all spheres of modern social life (economy, sports, medical industry, pedagogy, etc.)" (Malkova, 2006). The first table shows the numerical ratio of such publications in the above mentioned newspapers, where ethnic stereotypes appear in various subjects.                The name of the periodical and its descriptionTotal quantity from January to June 2015The publications directly based on the ethnic stereotypesEthnic stereotypes that are covered circumstantiall yNumber of publicati on concerni ng titular (Kazakh ) nationPublications about the ethnic stereotypes of different nations                Egemen Kazakhstan newspaper, daily national periodical, published in Kazakh, circulation - around 135 thousand121910145                Kazakhiyasocio-politicalperiodical,newspaper, distributed in the country and possibly abroad, published in Kazakh and Russian, circulation – 17777newspaper, weekly independent263811-      Table 1: The numeric figures of articles with ethnic stereotypes in Egemen Kazakhstan and Kazakhiya newspapers  Among the publications on ethnic mentality, about the features and characteristics of the nation, i.e. direct ethnic stereotypes are: 1.

The indication in Kazakhiya newspaper is 42,3%. The ethnic mentality, special article about the nation specific feature are dedicated to the titular Kazakh nation.
 well as the idea is given with the implicit syntactic structure in correlation of logical and associative language unit systems.2) The heading of the article is given in an attributive phrase, and the ethnonym (the name of the ethnos) executes 2 roles in the phrase: a) a feature inherent to the subject; b) the point of view about the ethnos is deep in the semantics. For instance, in the heading of the article «Орыс» Қасымбек Orys" Kassymbek '"Russian" Kassymbek' (Egemen Kazakhstan, 18.02.2015, No. 31, p.13) the ethnonym is given in quotation marks because the name Kassymbek is inherent to a Kazakh person. It means that the article was named so because Kazakh person Kassymbek, has many Russians features in his nature. In this regard the phrase "орыстығына салу" orystygyna salu 'in Russian manner' is used. This phrase means that in some way Russian ethnos is different from Kazakhs customs in some cases and means the features inherent to Russian nation. In this article the author uses this phrase in order to refer to such peculiar features of Russians as when they come to someone to ask for help, they get to the issue right away, their ability make use of anything in their hands, generosity, their ability to share with someone what they have and do not think of how to get it back.3) The evaluation of ethnos or point of view about it is given in the heading without naming the ethnos, yet, by using general synonyms as nation, country or public. For instance, the heading as "Еңбекті еншілеген ел" Enbekti enshilegen el 'The nation that has mastered the labour' (Egemen Kazakhstan, 04.04.2015, no.61, p.9) excites the readers' interest as the ethnonym is given covertly. Only after reading we can understand that the hard working nation or those that that have mastered the labor are the Chinese. 4) Ethnic stereotypes take place in linguistically thrifty sentences that are based on similizing the features of one nation to another. For instance, "Корей жақсылықты ұмытпайтын, ізгілік, бауырмалдық, үлкенді сыйлау сияқты азаматтық қасиеттерімен қазақ халқына ұқсас" Korei zhaksylykty umytpaityn, izgilik, bauyrmalbiliq, ulkendi syilau siyaqty azamattyq qasietterimen qazaq halqyna uqsas 'Koreans are similar to Kazakhs with their full hearted nature that remember the good, kindness, tenderness, and respect to the elderly' (Korei zhurty// Egemen Kazakhstan, 30.01.2015, No.19, p. 2) The semantics of the sentence makes it clear that 2 Analysis of the ethnic stereotypes in Egemen Kazakhstan and Kazakhiya newspapersEthnic stereotypes in Egemen Kazakhstan newspaper and their linguistic formation. Various ethnic information published in the above mentioned newspapers regarding the level of capacity in different spheres, anthropological indicators, labor habits, scope, behavior, psychological pecularities, mentality, character, etc. are known for various linguistic compositions and language tools that are used to form ethnic stereotypes regarding the typical features of one ethnic group, similar associations and many constant standard understandings created in the mentality of the society.This made it possible to classify the linguistic peculiarities of the ethnic stereotypes in Egemen Kazakhstan newspaper in the following way:1) Evaluation of ethnics, headings of the articles that hide the understanding in its' semantics. For example, such headings of articles as Қазақ десе кӛз алдыма Абай атам келеді Qazaq dese, kozaldyma Abay atam keledi 'I imagine Abay, when they say Kazakh' (Egemen Kazakhstan, 14.01.2015. No. 7, p.3) or Kazakh zherine uzatylganima esh okinbeimin 'I do not regret that I got married to a Kazakh' (Egemen Kazakhstan, 27.01.2015, No.16, p.2) create positive associations in the mentality of the readers and positive evaluation is implicit. Thus, in the first case the idea regarding the nation is given with the help of the image of great Kazakh philosopher and poet. Likewise, the phrase "Qazaqdese" (when called Kazakh) shows us that the author is from other nation. In the second case, the word "okinbeimin" (I do not regret) can be an example of positive evaluation of Kazakh land and people as well. In the same direction are the following articles Дәнекер: Қазақтың шаңырағын шалқытқан башқұрт қызы Daneker: Kazakhtyn shanyragyn shalqytqan bashkurt kyzy 'Daneker: a Bashkurt Girl who destroyed Kazakh Family' (Egemen Kazakhstan, 12.02.2015, No.28, p.5), Аға досым – Лю Чан Aga dossym - Lu Chang 'My Brother and a Friend - Lu Chang' (Egemen Kazakhstan, 25.02.2015, No. 37, p. 11), where we can easily identify the positive view about Bashkurt and Chinese nationalities. Thus, despite the fact that there is no specific linguistic element based on the correlation of objective circumstances to the subject in conveying the thought the meaning is grasped with other language unit correlation, as
  the named characteristics are inherent to both Koreans and Kazakhs.5) In the names of some articles that are not dedicated to any specific ethnos there are sentences where there is no direct generalized evaluation and the opinion is given implicitly. For instance, Дмитрий Гуркин: «Ата-анам шаңыраққа келін етіп, қазақ қызын алып келгеніме риза болды» Dmitri Gurkin: "Ata- anam shanyraqqa kelin etip qazaq qyzyn alyp kelgenime riza boldy" 'My parents were happy that I brought a Kazakh girl as my wife to our house'. (Egemen Kazakhstan, 01.05.2015, No. 81, p.9)6) Inflexional endings as -ша, ше -sha, -shye '-ese' are added to the ethnonym, along with giving comparative meaning, it evaluates that ethnos and in some context it suggests to take them as an exemplar. For instance, Тілдің құқын эстонша қорғай алар ма екенбіз... Tildin quqyn estonsha qorgai alar ma ekenbiz 'Can we defend the status of language as Estonian' (Kazakhs must speak kazakh with the ethnos in the country//Egemen Kazakhstan, 23.04.2015, No. 74, p. 9). Here the author makes an example ofthe Estonians that guard the status of their native language, and highlights that this can be a good exemplar for the Kazakhs.7) Positive or negative evaluation of a favorite action of an ethnos in determined in the text, and it can be considered as a bright example of the cultural differences of two nations. For instance, Лондонның тас кӛшелерінде ит жетектеген ағылшындар Londonnin koshelerinde it zhetektegen agylshyndar 'Englishmen walking a dog on the streets of London' (Itke torden tosek salatindar//Egemen Kazakhstan, 13.01.2015, No. 16, p.10) conveys typical image of Englishmen in the mentality of the Kazakhs. According to the  title of the article the Englishman are referred to those "who make a bed for their dogs in the place of honor". This ethnic stereotype regarding the Englishmen is negative for the Kazakhs, for those who have such sayings as "no angel will enter a house with dogs", "letting the dog in once is negligence", despite the fact that they consider dogs as one of the seven sacred things.        Ethnics/ names of nations in territorial unitsEthnic stereotypes          Auto-stereotypesHetero-stereotypes           KazakhHopeful, believe in wise and holly features; main - not risky, humble, enduring, patient, accurate in making decisions, lazySympathetic, never forgets good, respect for the elderly, kind-hearted, tolerant towards other nations, tight-knit, ready to help others           TurkishMuslim peopleCourageous, carrying, kind, hardworking, agile, businesslike           Russian-One-sided, but able to lean when needed, generous, businesslike, able to make use of what they have           GermanCautious, businesslike           ChineseHard working, patient, careful, nation that cares about family values           KoreanKind-hearted, never forgets good, respect for elderly, sensitiveHardworking           JewishHonorable, sober-minded, rationalKind, generous           EstonianPatriot, forbearing, active proponent        Table 2: Ethnic stereotypes seen in the publication in Egemen Kazakhstan in the period from January to June 2015
 Lexical and semantic peculiarities of auto- and hetero-stereotypes in Kazakhiya newspaperIt is obvious that in Kazakhiya newspaper the presence of ethnic stereotypes regarding the evaluation and ideas of Kazakhs about themselves is great. The reason for considering them as auto-stereotypes is the language models of the author as "біз қазақтар" biz kazakhtar (we the kazakhs). For instance, the phrase "жалтақ қазақ" zhaltak kazakh 'weak-hearted kazakh' is used in such context in the sentence "Ресейдің боданында құлдық ұрған, сол саясаттың қамшысы ӛтіп кеткен, сонымен күн кӛріп, қалыптасқан жалтақ қазақ болдық" Reseidin bodaninda quldyq urgan, sol sayasattin qanshysy otip ketken, sonymen kun korip, qalyptasqan zhaltaq qazaq boldyq 'The reason why it is regarded as ethnic stereotype is that the phrase grammatically is not formed in first person, singular and refers to the author only, but in plural form to all Kazakh nation, and is in syntactic relation with the verb'.The word "жалтақ" zhaltaq is referred to all the nation, not only to one person, it shows the weak-heartedness of kazakh nation due to a certain period in the history of the nation, thus connects it with the time under the reign of Soviet Union. "Ресейдің боданында құлдық ұрған, сол саясаттың қамшысы ӛтіп кеткен, сонымен күн кӛріп, қалыптасқан жалтақ қазақ болдық». Біз бодандықтың ұлттық мінез- құлқымызға таңба салғанын енді сезінудеміз. Оның бір кӛрінісі – сенімсіздік! Ешкімге де, ешнәрсеге де сенбеу! Ондай секемшіл адам айналасына күдікпен, күмәнмен қарайды, жаңадан қорқады, қабылдамайды" Biz bodandyktyn ulttyq minez- qulqymyzga tanba salganyn endi sezinudemiz. Onyn bir korinisi - senimsizdik! Eshkimge de eshnarsege de senbeu! Onday sekemshil adam aynalasina kudikpen, kumanmen qaraidy, zhanadan qorqady, qabyldamaydy 'We are now feeling how the dependence influenced our national traits. One of its reflections is insecuirity! Believing in noone and to nothing! Such insecure person will be looking around with doubt and discredit, will be afraid of new, and will not accept it' (Zhemqorlyq qaidan zhabysty, qalay zhukty?//Kazakhiya, 02.04.2015).From this point of view we can see that the dynamic nature of ethnic stereotypes is dependent on the historical events and development of the nation. The following scientific conclusion of L. Gumilyev also showsthe dynamic nature and the factors that influence them: "В содержании этнических стереотипов следует различать относительно устойчивое ядро — комплекс представлений о внешнем облике представителей данного народа, о его историческом прошлом, особенностях образа жизни и трудовых навыках — и ряд изменчивых суждений относительно коммуникативных и моральных качеств данного народа. Изменчивость оценок этих качеств тесно связана с меняющейся ситуацией в межнациональных и межгосударственных отношениях" 'The more or less stable core must be highlighted in the content of ethnic stereotypes, i.e. complex of understandings about the appearance of the representatives of the nation, about their historical past, the peculiarities of their lifestyle and labor abilities and range of relatively dynamic communicative and moral features of the nation. The dynamics of the evaluation of that traits is closely related to the dynamic situation in international and interstate relations' (2006).The constant core of ethnic stereotypes mentioned by the scientists are referred as "the customs that became second nature" in Abay's works (1968). It is important to note the idea as: "Этникалық стереотиптер қызмет ету механизміне сәйкес тұрақты және ӛзгермелі болып бӛлінеді. Алғашқы топқа жататын этностереотиптер ғасырлар бойында қалыптасып, ақпараттық мәдениеттер ықпалына қарамастан мәдени ӛзгерістерге ұшырамайды. Екінші топтағы этникалық стереотиптер мәдениаралық қарым- қатынастар, этникалық қақтығыстар үдерісінде БАҚ кӛмегімен қалыптасып, ӛзгермелі сипатқа ие болады" 'Ethnic stereotypes according to their services is divided into constant and dynamic. The ethnic stereotypes of the first group are formed during centuries, that did not change despite the mass media. Those in the second group are formed with the help of mass media, as the result of cross cultural communication ethnic conflicts and possess dynamic nature' (Gladkih, 2001)It is possible to give the following hetero- stereotype as an example of ethnic stereotypes that is referred to only one nation and does not undergo any changes: "Всем известны немецкая пунктуальность и аккуратность. Так вот, в самые тяжелые для Германии дни второй мировой войны производство на военных заводах страны продолжалось, и
количество брака не увеличилось — как было ниже процента, так и осталось (почитайте мемуары Шпеера). Почему? Немецкое отношение к труду! Еще показательнее воспоминания немецких солдат, попавших в плен на Восточном фронте.Например, «воздушный стрелок» К. Фритцше, оказавшись в плену, поражался наплевательскому отношению к своему труду советских рабочих-заключенных и рассуждал о том, что, если уж тебе дали работу, то выполнять ее нужно хорошо и качественно" Vsem izvestny nemeckaya punktualnost i akkuratnost. Tak vot, v samye tyajelye dlya Germanii dni vtoroi mirovoi voiny proizvodstvo na voennyh zavodah strany prodoljalos, i kolichestvo braka ne uvelichilos - kak bylo nizhe procenta, tak i ostalos (pochitaite memuary Shpeera). Pochemu? Nemeckoe otnowenie k trudu!Eshe pokazatelnee vospominaniya nemeckih soldat, popavshih v plen na Vostochnom fronte.Naprimer, ''vozdushnyi strelok" K. Fritzshe, okazavshis v plenu, porazhalsya naplevatelskomu otnosheniyu k svoemu trudu sovetskih rabochih-zaklyuchennyh i rassuzhdal o tom, chto, esli uj tebe dali rabotu, to vypolnyat ee nujno horosho i kachestenno 'German punctuality and accurateness is obvious for everyone. So, during the most difficult for the Germans days of Second World War the production on the military factoriesof the country continued, and the quantity of the defectsdid not grow, it stayed at the same pace. Why? It is the relation of Germans to the work. And the descriptive memories of German soldiers, that were in thrall to East front. For example, "air-gunner" K. Fritsch, that was taken captive was surprised by the neglecting attitude of the Soviet workers- captives to their work and thought about that if you were given a job, you have to fulfill it well and qualitatively' (E. Zhumagaziyev. Kakoi ty. covremennyi kazah? Kazakhiya, 05.01.2015).In such a manner the phrase "zhaltak qazaq" in its' deep meaning gave information not only about the traits as being insecure when making a decision, relying on someone stronger, but also the factors and reasons that created the feature, and it also contains the information that it appeared as the result of a specific time span of the country's history. The phrase is also in logical and semantic relation with the sentence as " Бойымыз бен ойымызға құлдық мінез дендеп енді" Boyimiz ben oyimizga quldyq minez dendep endi 'The slavery traits became secondnature of ours'. It also give definition to the phrase as it is the result of not identifying themselves as a nation and absence of national consciousness.One of the next lexemes used in Kazakhiya newspaper is the phrase "кең қолтық қазақ" ken qoltyq qazaq 'goodhearted Kazakh'.The phrasal verb used in Kazakhiya newspaper "ken qoltyq qazaq" meaning goodhearted, genial, kindly is in syntactic relation with the ethnonym Kazakh and descibes the amiable and well disposed traits of Kazakhs in communication with other nations.There are hetero-stereotypes along with the auto- stereotypes about other nations in Kazakhiya newspaper. For instance, the chauvinistic views of Russian from the point that in the movies about the Second World War in 1941-1945 only Russians were praised for fighting for their motherland, and others were left unnoticed is used as a hetero-stereotype.Descriptions of the representatives of the mentioned class as казак атамандары Qazaqatamandary 'Cossack atamans', әлем- жәлем alem-zhalem 'raggle taggle', әскери киінген қауға сақал казактар askeri kiingen kauga saqal kazaktar 'bearded Cossacks in military uniform' can be also considered as hetero-stereotypes that give direction regarding their appearance.The general meaning of the ethnic information or context, as well as isolated syntactic constructions and standard ready cliché plays a key role in the formation of the ethnic stereotypes in mass media publications about one nation in the mentality of readers. For instance, "Сол қырғынды кӛзімен кӛрген 91 жасқа келген «Қан мен тер» романының авторы Әбдіжәміл Нұрпейісов: «Неміс әскерлері жарақаттанған Кеңес әскерлерін атып тастамайтын. Оларды тұрғызып ауруханасы бар лагерьлерге жіберетін», – дейді" Sol qırgındı kozimen korgen 91 jasqa kelgen «Qan men ter» romanının avtorı Abdijamil Nurpeyisov: «Nemis askerleri jaraqattangan Kenes askerlerin atıp tastamaytın. Olardı turgızıp auruhanasi bar lagerlerge jiberetin», – deidi '91 year-old author of "Kan men ter" roman A.Nurpeisov, the one that has seen the war said: "The German army did not shoot the armed Soviet soldiers. They carried them to the camps with hospitals". In this context we can forecast the formation of positive ethnic stereotype regarding the sympathetic feelings, humanness of the German soldiers'.
There are also following negative hetero- stereotypes along with the positive ones in Kazakhiya newspaper as: "Кавказ ұлтының бiр адамы да келiптi. Кәдiмгi, сайда-саны, құмда- iзi жоқ, жеңiл пайда iздеп жортып жүретiн кавказдықтардың бiрi. Бұл жақтағы қазақтың түсiнiгiнше, кавказдық дегендер «ерекше халық». Олар кез келген ауданның, облыстың әкiмдерiнiң есiгiн «теуiп кiредi», құқық қорғау ұйымдарымен ым-жымдары бiр. Қай жерде ақшалы орын болса, солардiкi" «Kavkaz ultının bir adamı da kelipti. Kadimgi, sayda-sanı, qumda-izi joq, jenil payda izdep jortıp juretin kavkazdıqtardın biri. Bul jaqtagı qazaqtın tüsiniginshe, kavkazdıq degender «erekshee xalıq». Olar kez kelgen audannın, oblıstın akimderinin esigin «teuip kiredi», quqıq qorgau uyımdarımen ım-jımdarı bir. Qay jerde aqshalı orın bolsa, solardiki» 'One man of Caucasian origins came as well. he is just one of the many Caucasian man in search of benefit. In the understanding of the local people the Caucasian are special people. They are able to kick any door of oblast or region governors, they have special relations with police authoritiesthey are always there, where there is money' (Qazaq zhane Quldik sana, 16.04.2015)Here the Caucasian nation is used not only as the name of an ethnicity but it must be used as the general name for the nations that live in the Caucasian region. As the result of the mentioned feature that is not directly related to the ethnicity we can say that the words as "searchers of easy benefit, in special relation with police, rich," create new hetero-stereotypes about Caucasian nationalities.In this regards, it is worth pointing out that only the historically constant features that became second nature and inherent to the ethnicity can only be consider adequate. We can point out, particularly, stereotypes created as the result of making judgments on the ethnicity taking into account the behavior of only one representative, as well as of ethnic conflicts, cross-cultural communication, and mass media are among them. The following point of view as "the saying of some clever people that "kazakh is a troublemaker and soul-taker nation" will only stay on paper as meaningless idea" also proves that sometimes the hetero-stereotypes are created fast, inadequately, and inappropriately (1862). Mostly all of the publications on ethnic theme in Kazakhiya newspaper contain ethnic stereotypes about the traits and features of kazakhs, mentality, labor habits, life style traditions andother character. It is closely related to the fact that these auto-stereotypes are created by the respected people of the nation and that the author identifies himself with this nation by using first person plural form, and relating the adjective to it. Also the linguistic investigation has shown that they are mostly negative. It is possible to note the auto-stereotypes are evaluated too emotionally and ironically. For instance, the article dedicated to the description of characteristics and mentality of Kazakhs in relation to the socio-political conditions in the country after the independence "Біз – қырсық халықпыз!" (We are stubborn nation) (Dos Koshim, 04/04/2015) the word "қырсық" (stubborn) used as an ethnic stereotype is playing a role of adjective and verb.In the publications we also can see proverbs and cliché phrases that are used to implicitly convey the negative traits of the country in order to describe the mentality of modern Kazakhs: 1) "Казах без понтов — беспонтовый казах"... Kazah bez pantov - bespontovyi kazah 'Kazakh without showing of is uncool Kazakh' 2) «Я от Баке (Саке, Маке и т.д.)» Ya ot Bake (Sake, Make and etc.) 'I am from Bake (Sake, Make and etc.)' (E. Zhumagaziev. Какой ты, современный казах?What are you like, modern Kazakh? Kazakhiya, 05.01. 2015).The reason why modern Kazakhs were called show-offs in this article is based on the following events, that we observe daily: «Ведь это мы берем кредиты для проведения пышных тоев, а потом расплачиваемся за них, сидя на чае и лепешках. Это мы покупаем сто тысяче долларовые джипы и ездим на них по городу, чтобы продемонстрировать свою «крутость». Это мы покупаем дорогущие смартфоны, а потом не используем их даже на 20% от их возможностей, потому как сервисы, которые предлагают эти гаджеты, в нашей стране недоступны и неактуальны.Знаете, наверное, картину — сельское кладбище, кирпичные или каменные мазары, блестящие купола и аккуратные мощеные дорожки, а в полукилометре — невыразимо грязный аул, косые стены, кривые заборы, отсутствующие дороги... Это наши «понты», Ved eto my berem kredity dlya provedeniya pyshnykh toyev, a potom rasplachivayemsya za nikh, sidya na chaye i lepeshkakh. Eto my pokupayem sto tysyache dollarovyye dzhipy i yezdim na nikh po gorodu, chtoby prodemonstrirovat' svoyu «krutost'». Eto my pokupayem dorogushchiye smartfony, a potom
ne ispol'zuyem ikh dazhe na 20% ot ikh vozmozhnostey, potomu kak servisy, kotoryye predlagayut eti gadzhety, v nashey strane nedostupny i neaktualny. Znayete, navernoye, kartinu — selskoye kladbishche, kirpichnyye ili kamennyye mazary, blestyashchiye kupola i akkuratnyye moshchenyye dorozhki, a v polukilometre — nevyrazimo gryaznyy aul, kosyye steny, krivyye zabory, otsutstvuyushchiye dorogi... Eto nashi «ponty». 'Itisuswhotakeonaloantomakeagreattoy (party), and then we pay for it, whereas we drink nothing but tea and eat nothing, but bread. It is us who buy cars and drive around the city just to show our "coolness". It is us, who buy expensive smartphones and do not use its' possibility even for 20%, because the application of those gadgets are not available or not timely in our country. You might know the picture - village cemetery, stone mazars, shining domes, accurate paved roads, and in half kilometers away there is a dirty aul, inclined walls, destroyed fences, absence of streets... These is our "showing off'.And the cliché 'I am from Bake (Sake, Make and etc.' is formed as the result of the action as using their relatives and acquaintances on a high position when solving some problems, especially concerning a job. The words Баке, Саке, Маке (Bake, Sake, Make and etc. are short forms of names. Traditionally, earlier according to kazakh culture shortening the name was accepted as respect to elderly or respected person, but nowadays, as the author mentioned using such form to a person means that he holds a high position, or is very influential and it is used in solving a problems or getting a job.The author also mentions the joke as:"казахское резюме — самое короткое в мире" (Kazah CVis the shortest in the world) regarding the above cliché. «Квинтэссенция, так сказать, менталитета. Совершенно отдельная тема — ситуация«Я от Баке (Саке, Маке и т.д.)». Как у нас шутят, «казахское резюме — самое короткое в мире». Тоже ведь кусочек менталитета. Это огромная проблема. Просто я знаю большое количество людей, которые стали успешными только потому, что они от Баке или от Саке. Бизнесмены, политики, артисты и т.д. добиваются успехов именно таким образом. Не все, конечно, так грустно», Kvintessentsiya, tak skazat, mentaliteta. Sovershenno otdelnaya tema — situatsiya «Ya ot Bake (Sake, Make i t.d.)». Kak u nas shutyat, «kazakhskoye rezyume — samoye korotkoye v mire». Tozhe ved' kusochek mentaliteta. Eto ogromnaya problema. Prosto ya znayu bolshoye kolichestvo lyudey, kotoryye stali uspeshnymi tolko potomu, chto oni ot Bake ili ot Sake. Biznesmeny, politiki, artisty i t.d. dobivayutsya uspekhov imenno takim obrazom. Ne vse, konechno, tak grustno 'Quintessence of, so to say, mentality. It is a separate theme- the situation "I am from Bake ( Sake , Make , etc.) ."There is a joke as "Kazakh CV is the shortest in the world ." It is also a part of mentality. This is a huge problem. I know a lot of people who have become successful just because they are from Bake or Sake. Businessmen, politicians, artists, etc. they achieve success in such kind of way. Not all, of course, but it so sad' (E. Zhumagazy . What are you, a modern Kazakh ?

There are no negative auto and hetero-stereotypes regarding titular or any other nation. Only the ethnic stereotype as "Englishmen walking a dog" is typical image in the language mentality of that nation, and we consider that their favorite thing is opposite to Kazakh culture not in the interethnic communication, but in the cross-cultural communication, serving for the empathy. The results of the content analysis of Kazakhiya newspaper: the 11 publications based on direct and circumstantial ethnic stereotypes make 42,3%, mostly they refer to the titular ethnic stereotypes. Kazakhiya is one of the weekly periodicals of multinational Kazakhstan regarding the numeric features of the stereotypes mostly contains auto-stereotypes about the titular nation of the country about Kazakhs, and there are more negative stereotypes, rather than positive. Numeric indications of positive and negative hetero-stereotypes regarding other 3 nations are approximately on the same level. There such ethnic key words and ethnic lexemes as қазақ Egemenдігі kazakh egemendigi 'Kazakh sovereignty', қазақ элитасы Qazaqelitasi 'Kazakh elite', қазақ тектілігі Qazaqtektiligi 'Kazakh nobility', қазақтың ұлттық намысы qazaqtyn ulttyq namysy 'Kazakh national pride', қазақ хандығы qazaq handygy (Kazakh Kanate), қазақ этнонимі qazaq ethnonymy 'Kazakh ethnonym', қазақ тарихы qazaq tarihy 'Kazakh history', қазақтың асыл арыстары qazaqtyn assyl arystary 'Kazakh nobel propugnation', қазақ зиялылары qazaq ziyalilary 'Kazakh intellectuals', қазақ автономиясы qazaq avtonomiyasi 'Kazakh autonomy', қазақ даласындағы Ұлы аштық қырғыны qazaq dalasyndagy Uly ashtyq qyrgyny 'Great starvation in Kazakh steppe' that refer to the history, culture, sciense, economy, historical people, and etc. of Kazakh ethnicity, convey ethnic information for the unification of the nation and to identify themselves as a nation.And the phrases as орыспиғылды шенеуніктер orys pigyldy sheneunikter 'governors with Russian features', орыстілділер orystildiler 'Russian-speakers', shala qazaqtar шала қазақтар 'those who do not speak kazakh well enough' might influence this trends negatively. We believe that the fact that the positive and negative auto-stereotypes about the titular nation of the country, the Kazakhs are present on a high ratio, and ethnic information concerning other nations is lower and the ratio of negative and positive hetero-stereotypes is approximately equal in Kazakhiya newspaper; and negative ethnic stereotypes about other nations of the country in Egemen Kazakhstan are absent is the guarantee of balanced interethnic relations in the country. The analyzed linguistic data from the Kazakhiya newspaper is the second nature or constant traits of Kazakhs, that were created as the result of socio-political events in the country along with the auto-stereotypes. According to the data given in the above table, we believe that the negative auto-stereotypes regarding Kazakhs were created due to the insecurity of the representative of the nation. However, the change from long-lasting positive auto-stereotypes to negative auto- stereotypes of Kazakhs about themselves is related to the social and economic development, their experience in cross cultural, interethnic communication with other nations.References:1.
