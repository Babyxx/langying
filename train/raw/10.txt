 Toward a Corpus of Cantonese Verbal Comments and their Classification by Multi-dimensional AnalysisAbstractThe information explosion in modern days across various media calls for effective opinion mining for timely digestion of public views and appropriate follow-up actions. Current studies on sentiment analysis have primarily focused on uncovering aspects like subjectivity, sentiment and credibility from written data, while spoken data are less addressed. This paper reports on our pilot work on constructing a corpus of Cantonese verbal comments and making use of multi- dimensional analysis to characterise different opinion types therein. Preliminary findings on the dimensions identified and their association with various communicative functions are presented, with an outlook on their potential application in subjectivity analysis and opinion classification.1 IntroductionNowadays there are numerous channels for expressing personal opinions. Views expressed in written forms are no longer confined to newspapers and magazines but are found everywhere in social media on the almost boundless internet. Meanwhile, the boom in all kinds of talk shows and phone-in programmes on radio and television have allowed both experts and non-experts to voice their views on many differentsubjects such as politics, finance, entertainment and leisure, just to name a few examples.The challenge in such information explosion has to be met by effective opinion mining, which has so far focused on the subjectivity, sentiment, credibility, etc. from written data. Spoken data and the sub-types of opinions are relatively less addressed, which motivated our current work.Opinionated utterances, or verbal comments, are likely to form a specific informal spoken genre as social media text has made a specific type of written language. They are distinct for utterance lengths, incompleteness, presence of speech errors, self-repairs, and speech planning evidence, amongst others. The comments may also be further categorised according to their communicative functions, such as presenting the speaker’s stance, giving advice to someone, providing information, making prediction, and evaluating or judging something. The effective classification of these different functions will be essential. This paper thus reports on a pilot study on the construction of a corpus of Cantonese verbal comments and the use of multi-dimensional analysis for characterising different types of opinions expressed therein, and discusses the potential application of the results in subsequent opinion mining work.Section 2 reviews related work. Section 3 introduces our corpus of Cantonese verbal comments. Section 4 discusses the linguistic features used in the preliminary multi-dimensional analysis done in the current study and the initial results, while Section 5 concludes with future directions.
 2 Related WorkOpinion mining often involves subjectivity and sentiment analysis. Subjectivity analysis aims at distinguishing opinionated sentences from factual statements, where the former is also known as private states, referring to one’s mental and emotional states which may express one’s attitude, feeling, beliefs, evaluation, speculation, etc. Sentiment analysis attempts to classify the polarity of subjective views as positive, neutral, or negative. A comprehensive survey can be found in Pang and Lee (2008), and Liu (2010).Past studies have mostly been concerned with written data, typically first-hand opinions like movie reviews (e.g. Pang et al., 2002), product reviews (e.g. Hu and Liu, 2004), or debates on web forums (e.g. Somasundaran and Wiebe, 2009), and second-hand opinions reported or quoted in news articles (e.g. Wiebe and Wilson, 2002; Tsou et al., 2005; Ku et al., 2006).Systems often leverage some sentiment lexicons (e.g. Wilson et al., 2005; Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006) and are thus primarily lexically based (e.g. Pang et al., 2002; Turney, 2002; Polanyi and Zaenen, 2006; Li et al., 2012), although tasks requiring more fine-grained information like opinion holders and targets would require more than simple lexical clues (e.g. Kim and Hovy, 2006; Lu et al., 2010; Zirn et al., 2011). Approaches using multi-lingual data are also gaining attention (e.g. Banea et al., 2010).Subjectivity may be associated with various communicative functions, such as presenting one’s stance, giving advice, making prediction, evaluating and commenting, etc. Such functions are achieved with a combination of rhetorical devices including but not limited to lexical choices. Corpus-based discourse analysis has thus often relied on multiple linguistic patterns to characterise register variations (Biber, 1988; Kaufer and Ishizaki, 2006).Multi-dimensional analysis, as explained and applied in Biber (1988) as well as Conrad and Biber (2001), makes use of multivariate statistical techniques like factor analysis to identify salient linguistic co-occurrence patterns (called “dimensions”) from a wide range of linguistic features. The dimensions are functionally interpreted and then used to characterise various spoken and written registers. Biber (1993), forinstance, identified five dimensions for the texts in the LOB corpus and London-Lund corpus based on 67 linguistic features. The first dimension has been labelled as “informational vs involved production”, where the former is marked by features like word length, nominalizations, prepositions, etc. and the latter by present tense verbs, contractions, first and second person pronouns, etc.The current work forms part of our project in which we investigate Cantonese verbal comments made in various domains and intend to use multi- dimensional analysis to characterise the comments and their respective communicative functions. Some preliminary results on corpus construction and the pilot study involving multi-dimensional analysis are reported and discussed in this paper. Our plan is to further employ the identified co- occurrence patterns of linguistic features for opinion mining in the future.3 3.1Corpus of Verbal Comments Data CollectionThe corpus compiled contains transcribed spoken Cantonese data from television and radio programmes broadcasted in Hong Kong during late 2013 to early 2014. They cover various domains (politics / current affairs, economics / finance, and food / entertainment) presented in different styles (such as interviews, phone-in programmes, singing contests, and food/film critics). Table 1 shows the data sources.3.2 Pre-processing and AnnotationThe transcription was done in verbatim with respect to individual speaker turns. The start time and end time for each turn were recorded. The role of a speaker within the programme (such as host, guest, reporter, and caller) was also noted. Self-repairs, hesitations, and pauses in the speech were indicated in the transcription accordingly. Table 2 shows an example, where the symbols //, ^^ and -- indicate intonational pause, self-repair and lengthening (by second) respectively. Transcription in Jyutping (for Cantonese) and an English translation for the content is given for reference. The talking speed for a given speech sample was calculated by the average number of syllables per minute.

 Sentiment annotation mainly follows the way explained in Wiebe et al. (2005). Annotators were asked to identify any opinions and other private states (e.g. beliefs, sentiment, speculation, etc.) expressed in the transcribed speech. First, the speech content may contain objective factual information as well as subjective opinions, as in the following examples respectively:今集星期六主場嘅嘉賓呢//亦有參與其中(Our guest today on Face to Face also participated [in the event].)即係你冇理由呢 eh 我叫所謂越級偷步嘅 (That means you have no reason to skip the steps and jump the gun.)Second, opinions and other private states may be expressed explicitly with private state verbs or specific polar elements or implicitly with different styles of language, as in the following examples respectively:呢個情況令人擔憂(This situation is worrying.)咁終於都出咗呢個諮詢文件喇喺啱啱呢個 禮拜啦(The consultation documents eventually come out this week. [implies the documents come out late])Third, opinions may be from sources other than the speaker, especially when the speaker quotes someone else who is the source of the opinion. Fourth, opinions may be expressed with different strengths, which may have to be judged in context. Fifth, different attitudes may be conveyed in opinionated speech, which may typically be neutral, positive or negative. Sixth, the opinions or attitudes may be expressed with respect to certain things, people or events, which we call the target. Finally, opinionated speech may serve various communicative purposes, as demonstrated by the examples in Table 3.For the annotation, the transcribed speech was first split into speech segments. In general the intonational pauses (marked with //) were taken as segment boundaries. Hence each speaker turn may contain one or more speech segments, and thesesegments may make up one or more speech events. A speech event is considered to correspond roughly to a full sentence in written text.For each speech event, as well as any private state expressed in a speech event, the following fields are to be filled: From (the starting segment), To (the ending segment), Word span (for events with explicit speech verbs), Subjective (whether it is an opinionated segment), Source (speaker by default or otherwise indicated), Target (the object of the opinion), Strength (how strong the opinion is: low, medium, high), Polarity (positive, neutral, negative), and Function (purpose of the speech event).Polar elements, or expressions in the speech conveying positive or negative sentiments, are also identified. For each polar element, the following information is to be provided: From (the starting segment), To (the ending segment, usually the same as From), Word span (the expression conveying polarity), Source (speaker by default, otherwise indicate nested sources), Strength (how strong the expression is: low, medium, high), and Polarity (positive, neutral, negative).    Function     Example    Stance 業主唔應該再加租囉(The owner should not further raise the rent.)    Evaluation/ Comment   唱就唱得唔錯//但台風差啲(The singing is not bad, but the poise is not good enough.)    Speculation   我好懷疑呢單嘢係咪真(I really doubt the truth of this case.)    Prediction     樓價應該會跌番啲(Property prices will probably fall a little.)    Elaboration/ Justification    因為可能就嚟加息所以...(The interest rate will probably go up, therefore ...)  Table 3: Communicative Functions of Opinions3.3 Materials for Pilot StudyThe current pilot study made use of a subset of the corpus from two domains: current affairs and finance. Speaker turns by host or guest were selected. Only those turns which last at least 10
 seconds were included. Each speaker turn was considered one speech sample. Drawn from about 150 minutes of transcribed speech from current affairs programmes and about 230 minutes of transcribed speech from finance programmes, a total of about 340 minutes of speech containing 495 samples with over 117K syllables were used in the analysis. The breakdown for individual domains and roles is shown in Table 4.whether...), and hypothetical situations (如 果 if, 就算 even if...). Speech planning features, including common fillers like 即 係 that is, 其 實 actually, etc., as well as speed and number of self-repairs, hesitation, lengthening and pauses in a speech sample.4.2 ProceduresThe frequency data obtained for the above linguistic features were tabulated and subject to Factor Analysis, following the process of multi- dimensional analysis discussed in Biber (1988, 1993). Factor Analysis is a kind of multivariate analysis which reduces a large number of features to a smaller set of factors based on their co- occurring patterns. In this study, SPSS was used as the tool to do this. With reference to the factors identified and the loadings associated with their component features, dimensional scores were computed for each type of text (in this case, speech produced by a certain role in a certain type of programme) with respect to each factor/dimension. These scores were based on the average of the sum of normalized frequencies for positively loaded features less that for negatively loaded features under a particular dimension for a given text type.4.3 Preliminary ResultsFour factors, corresponding to the dimensions in multi-dimensional analysis, were identified in the process. As demonstrated by Biber (1993), each dimension could be functionally interpreted according to the positive features and negative features associated with it. For example, the abundance of personal pronouns, especially first and second person pronouns, might indicate a high degree of interaction and involvement. Individual text types, or genres, could be characterised by not just one but many features which often co-occur or are simultaneously absent. Given the relatively small set of features of limited variety used in this pilot study, not all dimensions were found to associate with negative features. The possible functional interpretations of the identified dimensions with the corresponding positive and negative features are shown in Table 5.      Domain    Time (mins) Syllables      Samples           Host      Guest   Host     Guest        Host     Guest  Current Affairs  31.01 101.6410,434 32,593  86 154   Finance       72.80      134.10   25,367    49,164       129     126  4 4.1Table 4: Data Size for Current StudyMulti-dimensional Analysis Linguistic Features UsedThe following linguistic features were extracted and counted from the annotated materials described above. The quantitative data were then used in the current pilot analysis: Pronouns, including first person pronouns (我 I, 我哋 we), second person pronouns (你 you, 你哋 you), and third person pronouns (佢 he/she, 佢哋 they). Modals, including modal verbs likes 可能 may, 應該 should, 可以 can, 會 will, etc. Private verbs, including verbs indicating private states such as 諗 think, 覺得 feel, 認 為 think, 相信 believe, etc. Yes/No question words, including 有冇 have or have not, 係咪 did or did not, etc. and other A-not-A patterns. Wh-question words, including what (乜, 咩 嘢...), why (點解, 為乜...), who (邊個...), when (幾時, 如何...), and how (點樣...). Discourse connectives, including words indicating concession (雖然 although, 但係 but...), causal relation (因為 because, 所以 therefore...), conditions (除非 unless, 不論

The dimensional scores for each category along each dimension were computed. Figure 1 shows the comparison of the categories along the first dimension (D1) and Figure 2 shows their comparison along the second dimension (D2). In the figures, “Cur” stands for current affairs and “Fin” stands for finance.It can be seen that guests and hosts in both domains are quite clearly distinguished by D1, which is characterised by private verbs, first and second person pronouns, and wh-questions. These are indicative of interaction, involvement and stance. Guests in interview programmes are often asked for their views on certain subjects, while hosts are expected to remain as neutral as possible.D2, which is characterised by faster speed and abundance of speech fillers, modals and yes/no questions, reflects the uncertainty of the speakers and is likely to be associated with predictions rather than factual statements. This dimension thus singles out guests in financial programmes, who usually make predictions on financial matters and give investment advice. Table 6 shows a guest speaker turn from each domain of similar duration for a quick visualisation of the features found for D1 and D2. The relevant features are bolded and underlined.Figure 1: Comparison along D1 UncertainNormalFigure 2: Comparison along D2

D3, with the abundance of causal connectives and speech planning features, is characteristic of guests in both domains who often need to elaborate and explain the views, especially in current affairs discussions. Hosts in current affairs programmes often pose concise questions and let the guest respond, whereas those in financial programmes may pose more elaborated questions, or may even express some of their personal views with considerably more interaction with the guest. The differentiation of the categories along D4, for argumentation, suggests that guests tend to speak with more logical reasoning than hosts, and this is more evident for guests in financial programmes than those in current affairs programmes.Figure 3: Comparison along D3
  ArgumentativeDescriptiveFigure 4: Comparison along D44.4 Potential ApplicationGiven the feature co-occurrence patterns identified and their association with specific communicative functions, they can potentially be used as the features in a variety of approaches, including those based on rules or machine learning, for automatic subjectivity recognition and opinion type classification. Larger-scale data annotation is in progress, for opinions and other private states. The resulting annotated corpus is expected to provide more data as well as more variety of linguistic features for a more comprehensive multi- dimensional analysis. The relevant features for characterizing different categories of verbal comments will be applied in experiments on opinion mining.5 Future Work and ConclusionThe preliminary study reported here suggested that multi-dimensional analysis is a promising approach to characterise opinionated speech samples and differentiate their sub-types based on communicative functions.The immediate next step will expand the analysis to include more speech samples, possibly with a greater variety of domains and roles, to obtain more reliably distinguished dimensions, and to account for a wider range of opinion types and functions. So far we have relied mostly on lexical features, and more types of features will be necessary for a fuller picture of the genre characteristics of verbal comments. In particular, for lexical features we plan to add parts of speech, aspect markers, and sentence-final particles (which is very characteristic of Cantonese), and more importantly, for lexico-grammatical features we plan to include nominalisations, assertions, negation, and as far as possible, some discourse level features would be favoured. More tests on grouping and de-grouping the various features will be conducted and a more comprehensive analysis of the dimensions (with expanded datasets) will be done, for a descriptive account of Cantonese verbal comments as a specific spoken genre.Another important direction will certainly be the application of the dimensions (and the features therein) and dimension scores for opinion mining. We have outlined their potential uses and experiments will be done when more annotated data for training and testing are ready. This future work is expected to showcase the synergy between corpus-based discourse analysis and opinion mining applications.ReferenceBanea, C., R. Mihalcea and J. Wiebe. 2010.
