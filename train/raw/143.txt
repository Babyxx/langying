The Power of Investor Language on “Guba” Forum: Undervalued-Stock Detection on the Chinese Stock MarketAbstractIn this paper, considering that the work on using investor-forum postings to predic- t the Chinese stock market is limited, we explore data from Guba platform, one of largest Chinese investor forum. Specifical- ly speaking, we propose a strategy using investors’ postings on Guba forum to eval- uate how much attention investors pay to each individual stock. Then, portfolios are constructed according to stocks’ investor- attention degrees. In the experiments, a large scale (more than 100 million) of in- vestors’ postings crawled from Guba forum during from Jan. 2013 to Dec. 2014 and real market data from the Chinese stock market are used to test the effectiveness of our investment strategy. We not only ana- lyzed the correlation between the scores we assign to stocks and stocks’ actual returns, but also simulated the real investment sce- narios where our strategy and other com- petitors are used. The experimental re- sults verified the good performance of our strategy.1 IntroductionPeople nowadays routinely post their opinions in the web2.0 world (e.g. microblogging platform- s) about future events or changes. Therefore the predictive power of social media data has become an active research direction. (Tumasjan et al, 2010) investigated the predictive power of social media data to the outcome of elections. By analyzing about 2.89 million tweets, (Asur etSecond AuthorAffiliation / Address line 1 Affiliation / Address line 2 Affiliation / Address line 3 email@domainal, 2010) predicted box-office revenues of movies in advance of their release. The predicted target also includes the spread of diseases (Paul et al, 2011).In particular, there is a family of work fo- cus on predicting stock market with media data. Regarding the state of the art, influence of post messages on Yahoo! Finance in the modeling of financial stock variables has been studied in (W- erner et al, 2004). (Bollen et al, 2010) collect- ed and classified tweets to forecast daily clos- ing values of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Besides tweets, (Mao et al, 2011) surveyed the predictive ability of news headlines and Google search queries. (Oh et al, 2011) resorted to a microblogging service exclusively dedicated to s- tock market. (Nann et al, 2013) examines the predictive power of public data by aggregating information from multiple online sources. (O- liveira et al, 2013) provided a more robust as- sessment about the relevance of microblogging data for forecasting three valuable stock mar- ket variables: returns, volatility and trading vol- ume. More recently, (Chen et al, 2014) exploit- ed social media for stock market prediction with factorization machine.However, we found that there are few works exploring the utilization of investors’ postings to help investment on Chinese stock market. Par- ticularly, most of current work for the Chinese stock market relied on the data form microblog- ging platforms. As far as we know, there is no work explores the utilization of data from the Guba platform (www.guba.com.cn), which
      is one of the biggest investor forums in China. Different from microblogging platforms, Guba is a forum specifically targeted for investors and traders and most of the postings talked about Chinese stocks. Moreover, Guba has the largest number of users and daily postings among cur- rent Chinese investor forums. We believe it is worth studying the utilization of investor lan- guage posted on the Guba forum to help predict Chinese stock market. In this paper, we present our empirical experiment on undervalued-stock detection with Guba data. Our methodology is motivated by the idea that out-of-favor stocks are the ones to focus on. The studies on this idea verified that stocks that have not drawn much attention are more likely to be undervalued, and that by buying them, investors can wait for their true value to be realized. In our work, for detect- ing undervalued stocks, we take use postings on the Guba forum to evaluate how much attention investors pay to each individual stock (we cal- l this information as Investor attention degrees (IAD) of stocks). After estimating IAD values of stocks, a portfolio is generated by consider- ing the fact stocks that have not drawn much attention are more likely to be undervalued. Theabove strategy will be tested a large scale of in- vestors’ postings crawled from the Guba forum during from Jan. 2013 to Dec. 2014 and re- al market data of Chinese stock market. The experimental results validate its effectiveness.Figure 1: A screenshot of of Guba forum.1600014000120001000080006000400020000posting numberuser number stock number                                                Mar. 2013Jun. 2013Sep. 2013Dec. 2013Mar. 2014Jun. 2014Sep. 2014Dec. 2014Figure 2: The scale of Guba data we crawled.In the rest of this paper, after giving a brief introduction to Guba platform and datasets we crawled in Section 2, we describe our investment strategy in Section 3. Experiments are showed in Section 4 and conclusions are drawn in Sec- tion 5.Number

Details can be found in Algorithm 1.2 Introduction to the Guba Platform and Our Experimental DataAfter comparing several investor forum- s in China, we found that Guba forum (www.guba.com.cn) has the largest number of users and daily postings. However, there is no previous work explored the data from the Guba platform. Therefore, we study the utilization of Guba data on investment on the Chinese stock market. Figure 1 gives a screenshot of of Guba forum and shows that there are lots of investors’ opinions about individual stocks on Guba platform.Figure 2 gives the averaged daily number of posting, averaged daily number of stocks cov- ered and averaged daily number of users in each month during from Jan. 2013 to Dec. 2014 . Note that, at the end of 2014, Guba users pub- lished more than 15,000 postings in a day and this number is likely continues to grow. Final- ly, we got totally 116,155,987 postings published from Jan. 2013 to Dec. 2014 as our experimen- tal datasets.some day. We hope the the price of the selected stocks could become higher in the future (e.g., a month later). For that purpose, stocks are always sorted by strategy-defined scoring. The scores are expected to be proportional to the s- tocks’ returns. Finally, the stocks with highest scores are used to construct the portfolio.3.2 Undervalued-stock selection with Guba DataAs we mentioned in the Introduction section, s- tocks that have not drawn much attention are more likely to be undervalued, and that by buy- ing them, investors can wait for their true value to be realized. Peter Lynch (Lynch et al, 2000), who is America’s number-one money manager gave similar statement in his famous book. He said: “If I could avoid a single stock, it would be the hottest stock in the hottest industry, the one that gets the most favorable publicity, the one that every investor hears about in the car pool or on the commuter train―and succumbing to the social pressure, often buys...”. In sum, the s- tocks overlooked by the investors are more likely to be undervalued and have investment values. Therefore, if we can estimate the how much at- tention people pay to a stock, we can defined the scores of stocks inverse proportional to how much attention they got from investors.As introduced in Section 2, Guba platform owns lots of investors’ postings talked about s-and Shenzhen stock exchanges.Firstly, We propose a general problem formu- lation of investing strategies on stock markets. Suppose we plan to select a set of stocks from stock candidates (e.g., A shares 1) to buy on1A shares (Chinese: A 股) are shares of the Renminbi currency that are purchased and traded on the Shanghai  
 Algorithm 1 IAD based undervalued-stock se- lectionGoal:Suppose we need to decide which stocks to buy on day d (we call it as trading day) and the decision should be made before 07:00:00 (i.e., 7am) on the trading day.1: Start the web crawler at [00:00:00 on day d].2: After updating crawled investors’ postings published until [23:59:59 on day d − 1], stopthe crawler.3: Using the posting collection published dur-ing the time-window (i.g., from [00:00:00 on day d−30] to [23:59:59 on day d−1]) to calculate IAD values of stocks in candidate set S:and stocks’ actual returns. We will also report the investment performances under our strate- gy and other traditional strategies by simulating real-world investment scenario.4.1 Information Coefficient (IC) AnalysisThe use of correlation between forecasts and ac- tual returns is commonplace in the literature, often used as a measurement of investors’ skill. A prominent application of this is the concept of the Information Coefficient (IC) (for details, see (Satchell et al, 2015)). Not only can IC be used as a tool to rate analysts and fund managers but it also represents an important parameter in the asset allocation and portfolio construction pro- cess. Information coefficient is the correlation between the forecasts and the eventual returns The information coefficient ranges from 0 to 1, with 0 denoting no linear relationship between predictions and actual values (poor forecasting skills) and 1 denoting a perfect linear relation- ship (good forecasting skills).Figure 4 presents the average IC values be- tween the stocks’ IAD values and their returns: 4: forallsi∈Sdo5: V iad(si) = |Pid|whereP disthepost- |Pd|ing collection published during the time-window and Pid is the subset of Pd thatmention the stock si;6: end for7: SettheportfolioasthestocksinSwithlow- est k V iad values.tocks they are interested in. Therefore, Guba data is promising to be used to select out which stocks draw investors’ attention and then find the overlooked stocks. In more detail words, we employ Guba data to evaluate a metric called as the “Investor Attention Degree”(IAD) which describes the how much attention investors pay to a stock. Finally, we generate a stock-portfolio consisted from stocks with lowest IAD values. The graphical illustration and detail algorithm of our investment strategy can be seen in Figure 3 and Algorithm 1.4 ExperimentIn this section, we used the investors postings crawled from Guba forum (see Section 2 for de- tail information of this dataset) and real market data from the Chinese stock market to evaluate our investment strategy (introduced in Section 3). We will analyze the information coefficient and monotonic correlation between IAD valuespd+30 − pdR(s)= s s, (1)  pdswhere R(s) indicates the return of stock s, pd+30s and pds denote the closing prices of s on dayd + 30 and d, respectively. Recall the acknowl- edged conclusion in economics (Grinold, 2000): “A good forecaster has an IC of 0.05, a great forecaster has an IC = 0.1, and a world class forecaster has an IC = 0.15. ”. The IC ana- lyze shows that IDA values calculated from Gu- ba data is a great forecaster since the average IC values is 0.116.4.2 Monotonic Relationship TestMonotonicity testing is a very popular evalua- tion approach of how good a factor used to rank stocks is (for details, see (Tortoriello, 2009)). Here, we used Quintiles which is a common setting when using monotonicity testing to de- termine how good a investment strategies work from a quantitative point of view (Tortoriel- lo, 2009): if a strategy works, the top quintile

The Figure 5 shows the net asset value (a commonly used metric evaluating stock- portfolio performance (Grinblatt, 1994)) of five quintiles. The results verified that the stock per- formances are monotonically decreasing in IAD values (the lower IAD value is, the better the stock performs, and vice versa), which supports us to buy the stocks with lowest IAD values.4.3 Real-world Investment SimulationIn this part, we simulate the real-world invest- ment scenario. Suppose at the investment begin- ning, we have 100,000$ (i.e., the original wealth is 100,000$). At the beginning of each month, we constructed the portfolio as the stocks with lowest k IAD values. Then, We buy them with equal-weighted preference. Finally, we sel- l them at the month end. After selling stocks, the changed wealth will be used to buy stock- s in the next month. For simulating the real- world investment scenario, we set the charge rate as 0.3%, which is a commonly used value for real-world trading on Chinese stock market. Moreover, we also exclude the unavailable stocks (e.g., the suspended stocks) to make the invest- ment scenario more practical. Table 1 shows the how the wealth($) changes during the in- vestment process. We also present the return rate got from single trading in a month. Wefound that, after two years, the wealth becomes more than 180,000, which indicates the cumula- tive return within two years is more than 80%. And in most of months, we got positive returns.We also compare the performance of our s- trategy and some traditional strategies based on stocks’ fundamental information. Note that for faith comparison , we fix the size of portfolio as 10 (i.e., k = 10) for all strategies. The competi- tors includes:• Moving average (MA) Crossover: MA crossover rules, are among the most pop- ular and common trading rules discussed in the technical analysis literature (Fong et al, 2005). Here, we used (15-week MA minus 36-week MA) divided by 36-week MA as the MA Crossover used in our experiments. Note that low MA-Crossover indicates a cross below a moving average which can sig- nal the beginning of a downtrend. There- fore, we sort the stocks by MA-Crossover with decreasing order.• Turnover: Turnover = Sales or Rev- enues/Total Assets. Turnover is another measurement of stock popularity. “Mea- sured by turnover, the more popular a s- tock, the less its return; the less popular a stock, the higher its return.” (Liam et al, 2014). We sort the stocks with increasing order in Turnover.• Momentum: Stock return momentum is widely regarded as one of the most robustFigure 4: Average IC values in each month.IC values

Strong earnings generally result in the stock price moving up (and vice versa).

The final exper- imental results shows our Guba-IAD strategy outperforms the other competitors, which val- idated its efficacy again.5 ConclusionsThis paper proposed an empirical experiment on using investors’ postings on Guba forum to de- tect undervalued stocks by evaluating how much attention investors pay to individual stocks. Our work is the first first attempt at exploring the u- tilization of the data on the Guba forum, which is the largest investor forum in China, for pre- dicting Chinese stock market. The experiments shows the effectiveness of the our investing s- trategy. In the future, we plan to explore more on Guba data for predicting Chinese stock mar- ket, by cooperating with the economical work onstudying the relationship between investor be- haviors and stock movements (Diamond et al, 2012).ReferencesAsur, Sitaram and Huberman, Bernardo et al Pre- dicting the future with social media.
